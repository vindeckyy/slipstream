//! The session lifecycle loop: one SDL context on the caller's main thread driving the
//! window, the Vulkan presenter, input capture, the pumped gamepad service, and the
//! shared session pump's event/frame channels.
//!
//! Two modes over one loop: **single** (`run_session` — one `--connect` stream, exit on
//! end; the shell↔session contract) and **browse** (`run_browse` — the console library
//! idles between streams; overlay actions launch sessions, session end returns to the
//! library; the app quits only on B/window-close).
//!
//! Stdout is the machine interface (the shell↔session contract): one `{"ready":true}`
//! line after the first presented frame, `stats: …` lines once per window while the
//! overlay tier isn't Off (Ctrl+Alt+Shift+S cycles Off → Compact → Normal → Detailed;
//! the stdout line always carries the full Detailed text so parsers see a stable
//! shape). Logs go to stderr (the binary configures tracing so).
//!
//! In-stream chords all share the Ctrl+Alt+Shift prefix: Q release/engage, M mouse model,
//! D disconnect, S stats tier, V microphone mute.
