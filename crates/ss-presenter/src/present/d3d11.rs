//! D3D11 shared-texture → Vulkan import (Windows): the presenter half of the D3D11VA
//! decode path (`ss_client_core::video_d3d11`). Each decoded frame arrives as the NT
//! handle of a shareable single-plane RGB texture — **BGRA8** sRGB normally, **RGB10A2**
//! PQ for the HDR pass-through flavor (the decoder's VideoProcessor already did
//! YUV→RGB); we import it as a single-plane VkImage (`VK_KHR_external_memory_win32`,
//! dedicated allocation) and the presenter blits it straight into its video image — no
//! CSC pass. Single-plane RGBA is deliberate: importing the earlier multiplanar NV12
//! hand-off device-lost on NVIDIA however it was consumed (sampling or DMA copy, both
//! validation-clean — bisected 2026-07-09), while RGBA D3D11↔Vulkan interop is the path
//! Chromium/ANGLE exercise on every Windows driver.
//!
//! Synchronization is the texture's DXGI **keyed mutex** (`VK_KHR_win32_keyed_mutex`),
//! key 0 on both sides: the submit chains an acquire(0)/release(0) pair, so the GPU
//! waits for the decoder's conversion to complete before reading and the decoder's next
//! `AcquireSync(0)` on that ring slot blocks until our reads are done. Import is
//! per-frame (same discipline as the dmabuf path — parked in `Retired` until the fence
//! proves the GPU past it); NT-handle ownership stays with the decoder ring, the import
//! only references the payload.
