//! Input capture — the `ui_stream` state machine on SDL events, upgraded to real
//! pointer lock (the "stage-2 presenter's job" the GTK client deferred).
//!
//! Capture is a deliberate, reversible STATE (Moonlight-style): engaged when the stream
//! starts and when the user clicks into the video (that click is suppressed toward the
//! host); released by Ctrl+Alt+Shift+Q (toggles) or focus loss — held keys/buttons are
//! flushed host-side on release so nothing sticks down. While captured the pointer is
//! LOCKED (SDL relative mouse mode: hidden, confined, raw deltas) and motion goes on
//! the wire as RELATIVE `MouseMove` — the local cursor can't outrun or escape the
//! stream, so the only cursor you see is the host's. An auto-release from focus loss
//! re-engages on focus gain; an explicit user release (the chord) stays released until
//! the user opts back in.
//!
//! Keys are SDL scancodes → VK via `keymap_sdl`, layout-independent. Motion deltas are
//! COALESCED: one summed `MouseMove` per loop iteration (a 1000 Hz mouse would
//! otherwise send a datagram per event).
//!
//! The DESKTOP mouse model (design/remote-desktop-sweep.md M1) reuses this same engage/
//! release state but never locks the pointer: the local cursor moves freely (hidden over
//! the window — the host's composited cursor is the one you see) and motion goes on the
//! wire as absolute positions through the letterbox (`MouseMoveAbs`, latest-wins per loop
//! iteration). Requires a host injector with absolute support — gamescope's EIS is
//! relative-only, so sessions there are pinned to capture ([`Capture::new`] `abs_ok`).
