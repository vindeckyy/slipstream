//! The Vulkan presenter: swapchain + two frame paths into one device-local RGBA video
//! image, then a letterboxed `vkCmdBlitImage` composite.
//!
//! * **Software** (`FrameInput::Cpu`): staging upload + `copy_buffer_to_image` (row
//!   stride via `buffer_row_length`) — transfer-only, runs on every GPU.
//! * **Hardware** (`FrameInput::Dmabuf`): the decoder's NV12 dmabuf imported per-plane
//!   (`dmabuf.rs`) and converted by the CSC render pass (`csc.rs`) — zero-copy, gated on
//!   the four import extensions at device creation; boxes without them (NVIDIA
//!   proprietary by design) report `supports_dmabuf() == false` and the caller keeps the
//!   decoder on software.
//!
//! Pacing: one frame in flight (the submit fence is waited before each record), MAILBOX
//! when available, FIFO otherwise (`SLIPSTREAM_PRESENT_MODE=fifo|mailbox|immediate`
//! overrides — see `pick_present_mode` for why an arrival-paced presenter must not
//! block in FIFO's present queue). Present is arrival-paced by the caller: a frame
//! input on each decoded frame, `FrameInput::Redraw` re-blits the retained video image
//! (expose/resize redraws).
