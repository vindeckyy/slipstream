//! Client-side cursor rendering (design/remote-desktop-sweep.md M2): the host forwards the
//! pointer's SHAPE (reliable control stream, cached by serial) and per-frame STATE (lossy
//! `0xD0` — position/visibility), and WE draw it as a real OS cursor — pointer feel stops
//! paying the video round-trip (the Parsec/RDP model). Active only when the session
//! negotiated it (`HOST_CAP_CURSOR` in the Welcome — the host stopped compositing then) and
//! only applied while the DESKTOP mouse model is engaged: under capture the pointer is
//! relative-locked (SDL hides it) and games draw their own cursor in-frame.
//!
//! The host sends the bitmap in host-FRAMEBUFFER pixels, whose size tracks the host virtual
//! display's DPI scaling (32 px at 100%, 96 px at 300%). Drawn 1:1 it balloons on a high-DPI
//! host; instead we scale it by the SAME aspect-fit factor the video is drawn at
//! (`min(window_px/mode)`), so the pointer stays sized to the streamed desktop at any host
//! scaling. SDL cursors are fixed-size from their surface (no draw-time scaling), so we cache
//! shapes RAW and resample per install — rebuilding when the serial OR the fit changes.
