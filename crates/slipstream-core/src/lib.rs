//! # slipstream-core
//!
//! The shared protocol / transport / FEC core for the slipstream low-latency streaming
//! stack. It is compiled exactly once and linked by every host and client — directly
//! as a Rust `lib`, or across the [C ABI](crate::abi) by Swift / Kotlin / C clients.
//!
//! Everything platform-specific (capture, encode, decode, present, input injection)
//! lives *outside* this crate. What lives *here*:
//!
//! - [`fec`] — erasure coding. GF(2⁸) for GameStream/Moonlight compatibility (P1) and
//!   GF(2¹⁶) Leopard-RS (P2) which removes the ~1 Gbps per-frame shard-count ceiling.
//! - [`packet`] — `#[repr(C)]` zero-copy wire framing: splitting an access unit into
//!   FEC blocks of MTU-sized shards and reassembling them on the far side.
//! - [`crypto`] — AES-128-GCM session sealing, matching GameStream in P1.
//! - [`session`] — the host (submit frame → FEC → packetize → seal → send) and client
//!   (recv → open → reorder → FEC recover → reassemble) state machines.
//! - [`transport`] — pluggable packet I/O (in-process loopback for tests; UDP for real).
//! - [`abi`] — the `extern "C"` surface and `cbindgen`-generated `slipstream_core.h`.
//! - [`config`] / [`error`] / [`stats`] — session configuration, the shared error/status
//!   vocabulary, and the counters snapshot.
//! - [`input`] — the wire input-event vocabulary (keyboard/mouse/touch, gamepad snapshots).
//! - [`latency`] — the opt-in per-frame latency artifact (JSONL host-side records).
//! - [`reject`] — typed application-close rejection codes · [`reanchor`] — the post-loss
//!   freeze-until-reanchor client gate · [`render_scale`] — the shared render-scale setting ·
//!   [`audio`] — Opus PCM decode for C-ABI embedders · [`wol`] — Wake-on-LAN.
//! - `quic` (feature `quic`) — the slipstream/1 control plane: handshake, typed control
//!   messages, pairing (SPAKE2), the datagram plane codecs, and clock sync. With it come
//!   `client` (the embeddable NativeClient worker), `abr` (the adaptive-bitrate
//!   controller), and `clipboard` (the shared-clipboard transport task). `tls`
//!   (feature `tls`) — the pinned-fingerprint certificate verifier.
//!
//! ## Threading contract
//!
//! Nothing in the per-frame path touches an async runtime. `tokio`/`quinn` are gated
//! behind the off-by-default `quic` feature and used only for the control plane.

// Unsafe-proof program: every `unsafe {}` / `unsafe impl` in this crate carries a `// SAFETY:`
// proof. The bulk lives in `abi.rs`, whose sites are instances of the ABI contract stated once at
// the top of that file rather than 141 independent arguments.
#![deny(clippy::undocumented_unsafe_blocks)]
#![forbid(unsafe_op_in_unsafe_fn)]

// Wave 4: on-disk layout groups modules under `net/` and `runtime/`. `#[path]` keeps each
// public module a true crate-root `pub mod` (same path identity for dependents and the same
// cbindgen discovery order as the pre-move tree), so `include/slipstream_core.h` stays stable.

/// Bump on any breaking change to the [C ABI](crate::abi). Mirrors
/// `slipstream_abi_version()` and is checked by clients before use.
///
/// v2: `slipstream_connect` gained `client_cert_pem`/`client_key_pem` (pairing identities);
/// added `slipstream_pair` / `slipstream_generate_identity` / `slipstream_connection_request_mode`.
/// v3: added `slipstream_wake_on_lan` (Wake-on-LAN magic packet; the host's wake MAC(s) reach
/// clients out-of-band via the mDNS `mac` TXT record, so no connection is required to wake).
/// v4: added `slipstream_probe` (bounded, trust-agnostic, mDNS-independent reachability handshake —
/// the display-side companion to dial-first, so saved-host "online" pips reflect real reachability).
/// v5: added `slipstream_connection_next_rumble2` (rumble pull that also yields the self-terminating
/// TTL of a v2 envelope; `slipstream_connection_next_rumble` is unchanged and drops it). Additive —
/// the wire is backward-compatible (the envelope is a length-tolerant tail on 0xCA), so
/// [`WIRE_VERSION`] is unchanged.
/// v6: added the `slipstream_reanchor_gate_*` surface (post-loss freeze-until-reanchor gate for the
/// Swift client; Rust embedders use [`reanchor::ReanchorGate`] directly). Additive, client-local —
/// no wire change, so [`WIRE_VERSION`] is unchanged.
/// v7: added `slipstream_connect_ex8` (`status_out` — typed connect-failure reporting, including
/// the host-rejection block `SLIPSTREAM_STATUS_REJECTED_*` decoded from the host's QUIC
/// application close) and the `SlipstreamStatus` −20 block itself. Additive — the close codes are
/// new application-close vocabulary an old peer simply never sends/reads, so [`WIRE_VERSION`] is
/// unchanged.
/// v8: added the shared-clipboard client surface — `slipstream_connection_host_caps` and
/// `slipstream_connection_clipboard_{control,offer,fetch,serve,cancel}` +
/// `slipstream_connection_next_clipboard`. Additive; the wire grows only backward-compatible control
/// messages (0x40-0x44) and a new `Welcome::host_caps` bit, so [`WIRE_VERSION`] is unchanged.
/// v9: `SlipstreamFrame` grew `received_ns` — the reassembly-completion receipt stamp, so
/// embedders stop stamping receipt at the hand-off pull (which folds the pre-decode queue wait
/// into apparent network latency). Struct-size change on the frame poll surface = a hard ABI
/// break for embedders reading `SlipstreamFrame`; nothing on the wire moved, so [`WIRE_VERSION`]
/// is unchanged.
/// v10: added `slipstream_connection_clock_offset_now_ns` — the LIVE (mid-stream re-synced)
/// clock offset ongoing latency math must use; the connect-time getter stays frozen by
/// contract. Additive, client-local — no wire change, so [`WIRE_VERSION`] is unchanged.
/// v12: added `slipstream_connection_set_cursor_render` — the mid-stream cursor-render flip
/// (design/remote-desktop-sweep.md §8): the client's mouse-model chord tells the host who
/// renders the pointer. Additive; rides the existing control stream (a new message TYPE, which
/// pre-§8 hosts ignore), so [`WIRE_VERSION`] is unchanged.
/// v13: added `slipstream_connection_send_pen` — the stylus wire plane
/// (design/pen-tablet-input.md): a client sends `RICH_PEN` sample batches once the host
/// advertises `HOST_CAP_PEN`. Additive and capability-gated, so [`WIRE_VERSION`] is unchanged.
/// v14: added `slipstream_connection_report_phase` + the `SLIPSTREAM_CLIENT_CAP_PHASE_LOCK` mirror
/// — the phase-locked capture reporter (design/phase-locked-capture.md): a client that advertises
/// the cap reports its next display latch (already converted to host clock), the panel period, an
/// uncertainty and the circular arrival-lead statistic the host's controller steers on. Additive;
/// the wire grows only a new control message (`PhaseReport`, 0x32) an old host never reads and a
/// strict-prefix append on the 0xCF host-timing tail, so [`WIRE_VERSION`] is unchanged.

/// `slipstream_wake_on_lan` is client-local, and riding the C-ABI bump onto the wire locked
