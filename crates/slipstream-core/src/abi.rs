//! The stable `extern "C"` surface. `cbindgen` turns this module into
//! `include/slipstream_core.h` (see `build.rs`).
//!
//! ## Principles (plan §5)
//! - Opaque handles only: C sees `SlipstreamSession*`, never a Rust type's fields.
//! - All cross-boundary structs are `#[repr(C)]`; buffers are pointer + length.
//! - Explicit ownership: every handle from `*_new` / `*_pair` must be passed to
//!   [`slipstream_session_free`]. A [`SlipstreamFrame`]'s `data` is borrowed until the next
//!   `poll`/`free` on that session — copy it out before then.
//! - Versioned: [`slipstream_abi_version`] + `SlipstreamConfig::struct_size` for forward-compat.
//! - Panics never cross the boundary. Status-returning entry points use [`guard`], which reports a
//!   panic as `SlipstreamStatus::Panic`; the teardown/mutator ones that return nothing use
//!   [`guard_void`], which swallows and logs. The remaining bare ones are bare ON PURPOSE and only
//!   because they cannot panic: [`slipstream_abi_version`] returns a constant, and the
//!   `slipstream_connect*` shims forward every argument unchanged into a guarded implementation.

// THE ABI CONTRACT, stated once - most `// SAFETY:` proofs below are an instance of it.
//
// Every pointer crossing this boundary is C memory the CALLER owns, and the header
// (`include/slipstream_core.h`) is where that contract is published. Three shapes recur:
//
//  * HANDLES (`SlipstreamSession*`, `SlipstreamConnection*`, ...) come from a `*_new`/`*_pair` and
//    stay valid until the matching `*_free`. They are only ever reached through `as_mut()`/
//    `as_ref()`, which turn null into `None` - so a null handle is a `NullPointer` status, never a
//    dereference. Using one after `*_free` is the caller's error and the one thing this layer
//    cannot defend against.
//  * OUT-PARAMS are caller-owned writable slots of the matching `#[repr(C)]` type. Where the header
//    documents one as optional it is null-checked here before it is written; where it does not, a
//    null is rejected by the entry point's own guard before any store.
//  * C STRINGS are NUL-terminated or null, and are read through `opt_cstr`, which handles both and
//    borrows for the call only.
//
// Two properties hold everywhere and are not repeated per site: no pointer is retained past the
// call that received it (a `SlipstreamFrame`'s `data` is borrowed until the next `poll`/`free` on
// that session, as the module header says), and every entry point runs inside `guard`'s
// `catch_unwind`, so a panic becomes a status code rather than unwinding into C.
