//! Input task: embedder events → QUIC datagrams. Toward a host that advertised
//! HOST_CAP_GAMEPAD_STATE, the per-transition gamepad events every embedder still emits are
//! folded into idempotent, sequence-numbered full-state snapshots (`GamepadSnapshot`): the
//! datagram plane drops and reorders (and sheds oldest-first at the 4 KiB send cap), so a lost
//! per-transition event would corrupt held pad state until the *next* change — a held trigger
//! stuck wrong indefinitely. Snapshots heal on the next send, the seq lets the host drop stale
//! reorders, and a periodic refresh of every touched pad bounds any loss to one refresh
//! interval — the same idempotent-state discipline as the host's 500 ms rumble refresh.
//! Keyboard/mouse/touch events pass through unchanged; an older host (no caps bit) keeps
//! getting the legacy per-transition gamepad events.
