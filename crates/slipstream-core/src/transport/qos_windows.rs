//! qWAVE (qos2.h) DSCP marking — the Windows path of [`super::qos::set_media_qos`].
//!
//! On Windows a plain `IP_TOS` setsockopt succeeds but the stack strips the mark from the wire:
//! marking requires membership in a qWAVE flow, which is how Apollo/Sunshine tag (qwave.dll).
//! [`QOSAddSocketToFlow`] with a traffic type yields the OS default marking (AudioVideo → DSCP
//! 40, Voice → 56, both WMM-mapped); the follow-up `QOSSetFlow(QOSSetOutgoingDSCPValue)` pins
//! the exact CS5/CS6 code points the other platforms mark. The pin needs an elevated process or
//! the "allow non-admin DSCP" group policy and silently keeps the traffic-type default
//! otherwise — the host runs as the SYSTEM service (`SlipstreamHost`), so the exact-DSCP path
//! applies exactly where it matters (the video egress); user-mode clients keep traffic-type
//! defaults (still WMM-useful).
//!
//! Same contract as the rest of [`super::qos`]: opt-in (`dscp_enabled`), and every step
//! debug-logs and continues — QoS is a nicety, never required for correctness.
