//! Wake-on-LAN: magic-packet builder + broadcast sender.
//!
//! Runtime-free by design — a magic packet is one fire-and-forget UDP datagram, so this needs
//! neither the `quic` feature nor an async runtime and links into every client (including the
//! QUIC-less builds). The Rust clients (Linux and Android) call these `pub fn`s directly;
//! Swift/iOS reach them through the `slipstream_wake_on_lan` C-ABI wrapper in [`crate::abi`].
//!
//! Reliability (this is the whole point — a sleeping host has no ARP entry, so a plain unicast
//! can't wake it, and `255.255.255.255` alone leaves only via the default route). For each
//! known host MAC we send the 102-byte packet to:
//!   * every non-loopback IPv4 interface's **subnet-directed broadcast** (routes to that NIC's
//!     segment — this is what covers multi-homed clients on VPN/docker/multiple LANs), and
//!   * the **limited broadcast** `255.255.255.255`, and
//!   * optionally a **unicast** to the host's last-known IP (covers the brief window where the
//!     host is reachable but hasn't re-advertised, and NICs that wake on a directed unicast),
//!
//! on the two conventional WoL ports (9 and 7), repeated a few times to survive UDP loss.
