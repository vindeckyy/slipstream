//! `slipstream/1` — the native control plane, gated behind the `quic` feature.
//!
//! GameStream is slipstream's compatibility layer; this is the start of its own protocol. A QUIC
//! connection (quinn, tokio — control plane only, never the per-frame path) carries a
//! length-prefixed binary handshake on one bidirectional stream:
//!
//! ```text
//!   client → host  Hello   { abi_version }
//!   host → client  Welcome { abi_version, session: full data-plane Config + mode + UDP port }
//!   client → host  Start   { client_udp_port }
//! ```
//!
//! after which both sides bring up a [`crate::session::Session`] over a plain
//! [`UdpTransport`](crate::transport::udp) (native threads, no async) and the host streams.
//! The Welcome carries everything the core negotiates — FEC scheme (including GF(2¹⁶)
//! Leopard, which GameStream can't express), shard sizing, crypto key/salt — so the data
//! plane is exactly the hardened core `Session`.
//!
//! Transport security: the host presents a long-lived self-signed certificate
//! ([`endpoint::server_with_identity`]) and the client pins its SHA-256 fingerprint
//! ([`endpoint::client_pinned`]; no pin = trust-on-first-use, with the observed fingerprint
//! reported back for persisting). The data plane adds AES-GCM on top.
//! All integers little-endian; every message is `u16 length || payload`.
//!
//! Split by concern (networking-audit deferred plan §3 — a pure move): `handshake` the
//! positional Hello/Welcome/Start codecs, `caps` the capability/codec-negotiation
//! vocabulary, `control` the typed control + clipboard messages, `pairing` the pairing
//! message codecs with [`pake`] the SPAKE2 itself, `datagram` the 0xC9–0xCF plane codecs,
//! `pen` the stylus batch (0xCC kind 0x05) + host stroke tracker,
//! [`io`] framed stream IO, `clock` skew estimation + mid-stream re-sync, [`endpoint`] the
//! quinn constructors, [`clipstream`] the per-transfer clipboard fetch streams. Every item
//! is re-exported here, so all existing `crate::quic::X` paths compile unchanged; each
//! module's tests sit at its own foot.
