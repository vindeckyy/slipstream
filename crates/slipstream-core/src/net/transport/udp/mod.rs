//! ([`Transport::recv_batch`], ≤128/syscall into a reused ring) on Linux AND Android (which is
//! `target_os = "android"`, not `"linux"` — it needs its own bionic binding, see `android_mmsg`)
//! — the 1 Gbps+ syscall lever (~125k → a few-k syscalls/sec at line rate). The host additionally
//! paces each frame's send across the frame interval (see `native.rs::paced_submit`) so a real
//! NIC doesn't drop a line-rate burst. All three layer on this same [`Transport`] seam (scalar
//! fallbacks for loopback and the remaining targets).

///   genuinely gone, the QUIC control plane times out and ends the session cleanly instead. (This is
///   the classic connected-UDP "ICMP errors are advisory" rule, doubly true with hole-punching.)
/// - `ENOBUFS`: a WiFi/wlan driver (e.g. `ath11k` on the Steam Deck) returns this — NOT `EAGAIN`/
///   `WouldBlock` — when its tx queue is momentarily full. Rust maps `ENOBUFS` to
///   `ErrorKind::Uncategorized`, so the `WouldBlock` arm misses it; without this a transient
///   tx-queue burst tears the whole stream down (observed live: the host streamed flawlessly on
///   loopback / under a debugger — anything slow enough not to fill the small wlan0 buffer — but
///   died at full rate over WiFi). Same lossy-drop contract as `WouldBlock`; FEC + the next frame
///   recover. Asynchronous network-path blips (`ENETUNREACH`/`EHOSTUNREACH`/`ENETDOWN`/`EHOSTDOWN`)
///   are droppable for the same reason a stale ICMP is.

///   burst (one `WSASendMsg` USO super-buffer is up to ~512 segments ≈ 700 KB) momentarily exhausts
///   the socket send buffer / AFD non-paged pool, and Winsock reports `WSAENOBUFS`, which Rust maps

///   Without treating it as transient a Windows host tears the whole session down under load
