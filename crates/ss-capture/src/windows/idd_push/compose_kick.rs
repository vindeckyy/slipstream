//! The LAST-RESORT DWM compose kick — synthetic pointer input that dirties a specific virtual
//! display so DWM presents it.
//!
//! Split out of `idd_push.rs` in sweep Phase 5.4. It is self-contained (one function plus a
//! process-global throttle) and it is the one piece of the capture path that reaches for synthetic
//! INPUT, which is worth keeping visibly separate from the frame machinery: it is unreliable by
//! nature, user-visible in the sibling-display case, and only ever a fallback for the driver's own
//! `FrameStash` republish.

use super::*;

/// LAST-RESORT fallback: nudge DWM into composing THE TARGET virtual display. DWM presents a
/// display only when something DIRTIES it — an idle desktop never does, so a freshly-attached ring
/// (session open, or a mid-session ring recreate) can sit at E_PENDING with no first frame even
/// though everything is healthy.
///
/// The PRIMARY first-frame mechanism is the driver's `FrameStash` (frame_transport.rs): the driver
/// retains the last composed frame and republishes it into every freshly-attached ring, so with a
/// stash-capable driver the first frame lands milliseconds after the channel delivery and this kick
/// never fires. It remains for pre-stash drivers and for the empty-stash cold start (a monitor that
/// has NEVER composed — normally the activation compose covers that). Synthetic input is inherently
/// unreliable — blocked on the secure desktop, defeated by a fullscreen game's ClipCursor, and
/// user-visible in the sibling-display case — which is exactly why it was demoted to fallback.
///
/// ss-vdisplay implements no hardware-cursor plane, so a cursor move is composited into
/// the frame — a guaranteed real present onto the IDD swap-chain (empirically what
/// `slipstream-probe --input-test` always relied on).
///
/// The cursor only dirties the display it is ON — proven on-glass in the Stage-W3 two-display
/// validation: display B's session-open kicks wiggled the cursor on display A and B never composed
/// a first frame. So the kick is per-TARGET: when the cursor already sits inside `target_id`'s
/// desktop region (always true single-display), two net-zero 1 px relative moves (the historical
/// behavior, pointer ends exactly where it started); when it sits on a SIBLING display, jump the
/// cursor to the target's center and straight back (`SetCursorPos` ×2 — each absolute move dirties
/// the cursor layer of the display it lands on, so the target composes at least one frame).
/// Best-effort — injection can be unavailable on the secure desktop, where a fresh compose just
/// happened anyway.
///
/// **COST:** the sibling-display branch SLEEPS 35 ms on the calling thread between the two
/// `SetCursorPos`es. The dwell is load-bearing (see the comment at that branch: a sub-tick
/// jump-and-return never dirties anything), but the caller is the capture/encode thread, so a kick
/// on that branch costs ~2 frames of latency at 60 Hz. Every call site is a first-frame or
/// post-recreate recovery window where no frames are flowing anyway, and the global 50 ms throttle
/// plus the callers' own 600–800 ms schedules bound how often it can happen.
///
/// **HID-first**: when the host has registered [`HID_COMPOSE_KICK`] (the resident ss-mouse virtual
/// HID pointer), the kick goes through it INSTEAD of the `SendInput` paths below. A report from a
/// HID device is real input to win32k — delivered regardless of this process's session or the
/// active desktop, it wakes a powered-off display subsystem (lid-closed laptop / display idle-off /
/// modern standby) and counts as user presence — every condition under which `SendInput` is
/// silently impotent (wrong session → wrong input queue; secure desktop → blocked; display off →
/// nothing composes at all). That set is exactly the lid-closed field-report state.
