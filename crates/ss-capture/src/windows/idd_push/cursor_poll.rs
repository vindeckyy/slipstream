//! GDI cursor poller — the Windows cursor-SHAPE source for the cursor-forward channel
//! (design/remote-desktop-sweep.md §8, the M2c redesign).
//!
//! Why not the IddCx hardware-cursor query (the v5 `CursorShm` path, now the fallback): it is
//! alpha-only BY DESIGN — `IDDCX_CURSOR_SHAPE_TYPE` has no monochrome value, the OS pre-converts
//! monochrome to masked-color (IDDCX_CURSOR_CAPS docs), and masked-color delivery is dead code on
//! modern builds (proven on-glass at every `ColorXorCursorSupport` level; no public evidence of a
//! MASKED_COLOR delivery anywhere). The driver keeps its hardware cursor declared at XOR FULL
//! purely so DWM EXCLUDES every cursor type from the IDD frame.
//!
//! Why not DXGI Desktop Duplication `GetFramePointerShape`: its `PointerPosition.Visible` goes
//! stale when the cursor moves only via injected input on current Win11 (Sunshine #5293 — exactly
//! a Slipstream session's topology), it burns one of the session's four duplication slots, and its
//! per-output metadata on IDD monitors has conflicting field reports. The GDI path below is the
//! metadata-forwarding-remote-desktop pattern (RustDesk, WebRTC/Chrome Remote Desktop, OBS): the
//! cursor is per-session global state in win32k, readable cross-process, and `CURSOR_SHOWING` is
//! the logical visibility — immune to all of the above.
//!
//! Works because the capture host runs as SYSTEM *inside the interactive session* on
//! `winsta0\default` (the service supervisor retargets the token — `windows/service.rs`
//! `spawn_host`), so the poller thread sees the session's cursor directly; no helper process.

// Every `unsafe` block in this file carries a `// SAFETY:` proof; enforce it (unsafe-proof program).
