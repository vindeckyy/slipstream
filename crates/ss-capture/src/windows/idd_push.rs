//! P2 direct frame push (kill DDA) — HOST side, over the **sealed channel**
//! (`design/idd-push-security.md`). The frame channel carries whole-desktop pixels, so its protection
//! must match DDA's (where capturer and consumer are one process and there is no openable channel at
//! all): the HOST (SYSTEM) creates the shared header + frame-ready event + ring of keyed-mutex textures
//! **UNNAMED** on the discrete render GPU — nothing to enumerate, open by name, or pre-create
//! ("squat") — then DUPLICATES the handles into the ss-vdisplay driver's WUDFHost process
//! ([`ChannelBroker`]; SYSTEM can `DuplicateHandle` into the LocalService host, the reverse is
//! correctly denied, which is why the HOST is the broker) and delivers the handle VALUES over the
//! SYSTEM-only control device (`IOCTL_SET_FRAME_CHANNEL`). A handle value is meaningless outside the
//! target process's handle table, so the bootstrap's ACL is not load-bearing; the only way to reach the
//! frames is to already be one of the two endpoint processes. The driver copies frames in; we consume
//! the ring straight into the zero-copy NVENC path — no DXGI Desktop Duplication, no `win32u` hook.
//! The SOLE Windows capture path. Driver counterpart: `packaging/windows/drivers/ss-vdisplay/src/
//! frame_transport.rs`. The shared `SharedHeader` layout, `MAGIC`/`VERSION`/`RING_LEN`, the
//! `DRV_STATUS_*` codes, the channel-delivery struct and the publish token all come from
//! [`ss_driver_proto`] (which OWNS the contract, with `const` size asserts) — both sides `use` it, so
//! drift is a compile error rather than a "must match" comment.

// Every `unsafe` block in this file carries a `// SAFETY:` proof; enforce it (unsafe-proof program).
