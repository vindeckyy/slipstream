//! Phase A.2 micro-probes (stall attribution, `vdisplay-disturbance-immunity.md` §4.2): a small
//! engine of watchdogged sacrificial threads that continuously measure the legs a capture stall
//! could hide in, so the stall reporter can read back "what was alive during the hole":
//!
//! - **fence** (one thread per hardware adapter): a tiny CopyResource + D3D11 fence round-trip —
//!   engine liveness. A Level-Two/Three adapter freeze ("graphics hardware is idle") stalls this
//!   for the freeze's duration on EVERY engine of that adapter.
//! - **dwm-tick**: `DwmGetCompositionTimingInfo(NULL)` `cRefresh` advance — the compositor's own
//!   clock. Frozen tick with live fences = DWM (or something it waits on) is blocked, not the GPU.
//!   The same sample also tracks `cFrame` (the COMPOSED-frame counter) — the compose-silence
//!   discriminator: a clock that ticks while `cFrame` freezes means DWM had NOTHING to compose
//!   (the foreground content stopped presenting); a `cFrame` that keeps advancing through a hole
//!   means DWM built frames that never reached OUR swap-chain (the OS frame-generation leg).
//! - **dwm-flush**: a watchdogged `DwmFlush` — its latency IS the composition-wait measurement.
//! - **scanline**: `D3DKMTGetScanLine` on an active output (Level-Zero reentrant — documented safe
//!   against every miniport lock, so a BLOCKED call here convicts the KMD itself). Prefers a
//!   physical head; on an exclusive topology only our IDD is active and the call's latency is
//!   still the KMD-liveness signal ([`ss_win_display::win_display::active_scanline_target`]).
//! - **cpu**: a high-res sleeper measuring overshoot — the DPC-storm / CPU-starvation
//!   discriminator (a machine-wide scheduling hole inflates every other probe too).
//!
//! The blocking of a probe is its measurement — none of these ever run on the capture/encode
//! path. Threads are DETACHED (never joined): a probe wedged inside a kernel call for the stall's
//! duration exits at its next loop turn after the stop flag flips. One engine per process
//! ([`acquire`]), refcounted across parallel capturers; probes sample at 20 Hz or slower and cost
//! microseconds each, so the engine is invisible next to a streaming session.

// Every `unsafe` block in this file carries a `// SAFETY:` proof; enforce it (unsafe-proof program).
