//! XFixes cursor source for the gamescope capture path (remote-desktop-sweep Phase C).
//!
//! gamescope draws the pointer on a DRM hardware-cursor plane and its `paint_pipewire()`
//! deliberately excludes the cursor from the frame it feeds its built-in PipeWire node — so
//! `SPA_META_Cursor` never arrives and the ordinary [`cursor_live`](super::PortalCapturer) slot
//! stays empty (a KWin/GNOME session gets its cursor from that meta; gamescope can't embed one
//! either, its `set_hw_cursor` is inert). We instead read the pointer from gamescope's nested
//! Xwayland via X11 — the trick Sunshine uses — and publish a [`CursorOverlay`] into that same
//! slot, so the encoder blend composites the pointer into the video exactly like the portal path.
//!
//! **Multiple Xwaylands.** gamescope runs one Xwayland per `--xwayland-count` (Steam Gaming Mode
//! uses 2: one for Big Picture, one for the game). The pointer lives on whichever is FOCUSED — an
//! inactive display's pointer is frozen. So the source connects to ALL of them and publishes from
//! the one gamescope is actually drawing the pointer on; it reads that display's shape too, since
//! each Xwayland has its own current cursor. This is why a single-display read froze the pointer
//! the moment a game on the OTHER Xwayland took focus.
//!
//! Three X sources per display, split by cost (Sunshine's split, plus gamescope's own verdict):
//! * **Position** — core `QueryPointer` on the root, polled fast. Cheap (a few-byte reply, no
//!   bitmap), so it can out-pace the stream fps and keep the composited pointer smooth.
//! * **Shape / hotspot** — `XFixesGetCursorImage`, refreshed only after an XFixes `CursorNotify`
//!   (a real cursor change). A fully-transparent image reads as hidden.
//! * **Visibility + focus** — [`GAMESCOPE_CURSOR_VISIBLE_FEEDBACK`](GS_CURSOR_FEEDBACK) on the
//!   root, read at connect and re-read on its `PropertyNotify`.
//!
//! **Why the feedback atom and not pointer motion.** gamescope hides its pointer by WARPING the X
//! pointer to the root's bottom-right corner pixel — it does NOT swap in a transparent X cursor, so
//! `XFixesGetCursorImage` keeps handing back the last opaque arrow. The original "follow whichever
//! display's pointer moved" heuristic therefore stuck to the parked display (a parked pointer never
//! moves again) and composited that arrow at `(w-1, h-1)`: a sliver of cursor welded to the corner
//! of the stream for the rest of the session, while the real pointer went undrawn. Reported
//! on-glass as "part of cursor shows up on bottom right … isn't where it really is", in every game
//! (a game grabs the pointer, so the hide is permanent). Measured on a live 1920x1080 Gaming Mode
//! session: real motion ⇒ pointer live + feedback `1`; 3 s idle (`--hide-cursor-delay 3000`) ⇒
//! pointer `(1919, 1079)` + feedback `0`. The atom answers BOTH questions correctly for a static
//! pointer, which motion cannot: which Xwayland owns it, and whether to draw it at all — so
//! honouring it also gives the stream gamescope's own idle auto-hide, which this source never had.
