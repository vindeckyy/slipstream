//! Live capture: xdg ScreenCast portal (`ashpd`) → PipeWire (`pipewire`), CPU-copy path.
//!
//! Two dedicated threads, because both stacks are tied to their thread:
//!   * **portal thread** drives the async ashpd handshake on a multi-thread tokio runtime
//!     (control plane — never the per-frame path), then parks on a oneshot receiver so the
//!     `proxy` + its zbus connection stay alive (the cast is torn down when that connection
//!     drops; ashpd's `Session` has no `Drop`);
//!   * **pipewire thread** owns the (`!Send`) MainLoop/Stream and pumps frames.
//!
//! The portal hands the PipeWire remote fd + node id to the pipewire thread; decoded BGRx
//! frames leave the pipewire thread over a bounded channel. The authoritative frame size
//! comes from the negotiated PipeWire format, not the portal's size hint.
//!
//! Cleanup: BOTH threads are stopped deterministically — [`PortalCapturer`]'s `Drop` sends a
//! pipewire `channel` quit and joins that thread (releasing its EGL importer / CUDA context
//! promptly instead of leaking it to process exit), and [`PortalSession`]'s `Drop` fires the
//! portal thread's quit oneshot and waits, bounded, for it to unwind — which drops the zbus
//! connection and so ENDS the compositor's ScreenCast session. Dropping a capturer (session end,
//! or a retried/failed pipeline build) therefore leaves nothing behind on either side.

// Every `unsafe` block in this file carries a `// SAFETY:` proof; enforce it (unsafe-proof program).
