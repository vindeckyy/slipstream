//! Shared binary contract between the slipstream host and the `ss-vdisplay` IddCx driver.
//!
//! Two planes:
//! * [`control`] — the low-frequency `DeviceIoControl` plane (add/remove a virtual monitor, pin the
//!   render adapter, keepalive, info, clear-all, deliver the frame channel). Owned, clean, versioned —
//!   NOT the SudoVDA ABI.
//! * [`frame`] — the IDD-push frame transport: the host creates a ring of **unnamed** shared
//!   keyed-mutex textures (+ a header + a frame-ready event), duplicates their handles into the
//!   driver's WUDFHost process and delivers the handle VALUES over
//!   [`control::IOCTL_SET_FRAME_CHANNEL`]; the driver publishes composited frames into them. There is
//!   deliberately no object-name scheme: an unnamed object cannot be enumerated, opened by name, or
//!   pre-created ("squatted") — only the two endpoint processes ever hold a handle to any frame object
//!   (the sealed channel, `design/idd-push-security.md`). This crate owns the [`frame::SharedHeader`]
//!   layout, the [`frame::FrameToken`] packing, the channel-delivery struct, and the driver-status
//!   codes.
//!
//! Both planes were previously hand-duplicated, byte-for-byte, across `idd_push.rs`/`frame_transport.rs`
//! and `vdisplay/sudovda.rs`/`control.rs` with only "must match" comments guarding them. Defining them
//! once here — with bytemuck `Pod` derives and `const` size asserts — makes any drift a compile error.
//!
//! The GUID and LUID are carried as plain integers; the host converts to `windows::core::GUID` /
//! `windows::Win32::Foundation::LUID` and the driver to its own bindgen types via the same constants.

    // interactive desktop (the mouse section drives a real absolute pointer) and a read of the remote
    // user's controller state (security-review 2026-07-28).

    // `Device Parameters` key, the object namespace — an attacker at LocalService can read too, so no

    // driver bound to our devnode*: only that process answers I/O sent to the device the host itself
    // created (and the host looks the device up by the instance id `SwDeviceCreate` handed back, so a
    // planted look-alike devnode is not in the running). Asking the devnode "which process are you?"

    // have been: a rendezvous for a handle VALUE that is meaningless anywhere but in that process.

    //     -> [`HID_STRING_INDEX_CHANNEL_PROOF`], which needs no report-descriptor change. That
