//! Host side of the isolated zero-copy GPU import (design:
//! `design/zerocopy-worker-isolation.md`): spawns the `zerocopy-worker` subprocess, mirrors the
//! [`super::egl::EglImporter`] entry points over the [`super::proto`] socket, and materializes
//! the worker's pooled CUDA buffers in this process via CUDA IPC (each buffer's handles are
//! opened exactly once and reused as the pool recycles). A worker death — the whole point of the
//! isolation — surfaces as an `Err` with [`RemoteImporter::dead`] set, never as a host fault.
