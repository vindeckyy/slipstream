//! Zero-copy capture→encode (plan §9): the PipeWire dmabuf is imported into CUDA via EGL and
//! handed straight to NVENC, eliminating the per-frame CPU copies (at 5K the CPU-copy path
//! moves ~3.5 GB/s). On NVENC opt in with `SLIPSTREAM_ZEROCOPY=1` (the CPU-copy path stays that
//! backend's default and the runtime fallback: foreign-allocator / no-dmabuf / import failure).
//! On the VAAPI (AMD/Intel) backend zero-copy is the **default** — its LINEAR-dmabuf passthrough
//! replaces a triple CPU touch (mmap de-pad + swscale CSC + surface upload) — with a one-shot
//! downgrade to the CPU path if the compositor never accepts the dmabuf offer.
//!
//! Pieces: [`cuda`] (driver-API FFI + the shared `CUcontext` + device buffers), [`egl`] (the
//! headless EGLDisplay + dmabuf→`EGLImage`→CUDA import). The encoder's CUDA-frame path lives in
//! the encode backends (`ss-encode`); the dmabuf negotiation lives in the Linux capturer
//! (`ss-capture`).
