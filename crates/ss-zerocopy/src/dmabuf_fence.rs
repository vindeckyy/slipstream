//! Consumer-side implicit-fence wait for dmabuf capture (`DMA_BUF_IOCTL_EXPORT_SYNC_FILE`).
//!
//! Mutter renders its virtual monitor DIRECTLY into the PipeWire dmabuf and hands the buffer over
//! at GPU-submit time. With no fencing the consumer can sample mid-render and encode the buffer's
//! *previous* contents — the "stale/old frame" flashing on NVIDIA (KWin/gamescope blit into the
//! buffer so they don't hit this). The producer-driven fix is PipeWire explicit sync, but
//! Mutter+NVIDIA can't produce a sync_fd (`error alloc buffers` / no cogl sync_fd).
//!
//! So sync from the *consumer* side instead: a dmabuf carries its in-flight GPU work as an implicit
//! fence on its reservation object. `DMA_BUF_IOCTL_EXPORT_SYNC_FILE` snapshots that into a sync_file
//! fd we can `poll()` — readable once the producer's writes complete. This makes zero-copy capture
//! race-free WITHOUT the producer doing anything, *iff* the driver actually attaches the fence. If it
//! attaches none, the export yields an already-signaled sync_file (poll returns immediately) — no
//! wait, no harm, and `WaitOutcome::NoFence` tells us the driver doesn't fence (so zero-copy
//! would still race).

// Every `unsafe` block in this file carries a `// SAFETY:` proof; enforce it (unsafe-proof program).
