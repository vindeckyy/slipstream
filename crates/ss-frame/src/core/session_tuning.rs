//! Windows host-process session tuning — parity with Apollo/Sunshine `streaming_will_start`.
//!
//! The default Windows process runs at NORMAL priority and ~15.6 ms timer granularity, and lets the
//! GPU/display idle. Under a GPU-saturating game that starves our capture/encode/send threads (the
//! "240→40 fps collapse"), and the coarse timer floors any precise frame pacing. This raises the
//! process out of the default scheduling class, gives DWM and our hot threads MMCSS priority, drops
//! the timer to 1 ms, and keeps the (virtual) display awake for the session.
//!
//! Raw C-ABI FFI (winmm/kernel32/dwmapi/avrt) rather than the `windows` crate so it builds without
//! pulling new windows-rs features. No-op on non-Windows. Per-thread effects (MMCSS, execution
//! state) auto-revert at thread exit (= session end); the process-wide bits revert at process exit.
//! See `design/host-latency-plan.md` Tier 3A.

// Every `unsafe` block in this file carries a `// SAFETY:` proof; enforce it (unsafe-proof program).
