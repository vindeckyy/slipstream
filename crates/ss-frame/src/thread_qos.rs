/// descheduled by the game it submits the convert/encode late and the GPU priority never bites. Apollo
/// does the same (capture thread CRITICAL, encoder ABOVE_NORMAL). The Linux host needs this too: an
/// uncapped GPU-saturating title (e.g. CS2 direct on a virtual output, not capped by gamescope) is
/// also a CPU hog and can deschedule our submit threads. `critical` → highest non-realtime class
/// (the capture+encode loop); otherwise above-normal (the send/relay thread).
