//! # lumen-core
//!
//! The shared protocol / transport / FEC core for the lumen low-latency streaming
//! stack. It is compiled exactly once and linked by every host and client — directly
//! as a Rust `lib`, or across the [C ABI](crate::abi) by Swift / Kotlin / C clients.
//!
//! Everything platform-specific (capture, encode, decode, present, input injection)
//! lives *outside* this crate. What lives *here*:
//!
//! - [`fec`] — erasure coding. GF(2⁸) for GameStream/Moonlight compatibility (P1) and
//!   GF(2¹⁶) Leopard-RS (P2) which removes the ~1 Gbps per-frame shard-count ceiling.
//! - [`packet`] — `#[repr(C)]` zero-copy wire framing: splitting an access unit into
//!   FEC blocks of MTU-sized shards and reassembling them on the far side.
//! - [`crypto`] — AES-128-GCM session sealing, matching GameStream in P1.
//! - [`session`] — the host (submit frame → FEC → packetize → seal → send) and client
//!   (recv → open → reorder → FEC recover → reassemble) state machines.
//! - [`transport`] — pluggable packet I/O (in-process loopback for tests; UDP for real).
//! - [`abi`] — the `extern "C"` surface and `cbindgen`-generated `lumen_core.h`.
//!
//! ## Threading contract
//!
//! Nothing in the per-frame path touches an async runtime. `tokio`/`quinn` are gated
//! behind the off-by-default `quic` feature and used only for the control plane.
