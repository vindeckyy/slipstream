//! Virtual display orchestration (plan §6 / §W6) — the project's differentiator.
//!
//! A [`VirtualDisplay`] creates a *client-sized* output on demand, rendered natively and
//! headless (no scaling), to be captured and streamed, then torn down on disconnect. There is
//! no cross-compositor Wayland protocol for this, so each compositor has its own backend behind
//! this trait:
//!
//! * **KWin** — privileged `zkde_screencast_unstable_v1::stream_virtual_output` ([`kwin`]).
//! * **wlroots/Sway** — `swaymsg create_output` + `output mode --custom` ([`wlroots`]).
//! * **Mutter/GNOME** — D-Bus `RemoteDesktop` + `ScreenCast.RecordVirtual` ([`mutter`]).
//!
//! [`VirtualDisplay::create`] returns a [`VirtualOutput`]: the PipeWire node to capture plus an
//! owned keepalive whose `Drop` releases the output (RAII — no explicit `destroy`). Capture
//! consumes the node via the host `capture::capture_virtual_output`.

// `dead_code` is ENFORCED on Linux, where ~10k of this crate's ~17k lines live. Off elsewhere for
// one structural reason: `proc`, `session`, `routing`, `monitors` and `lifecycle` are declared
// unconditionally but exist to serve the Linux backends, so on Windows/macOS most of their surface
// is legitimately unreferenced. Scoping it this way rather than crate-wide keeps the platform that
// owns the code honest. (Was a bare crate-wide allow whose "scaffold, defined ahead of the target
// that uses them" rationale had stopped being true.)

// Every `unsafe` block in this file carries a `// SAFETY:` proof; enforce it (unsafe-proof program).

// …and that program only covers a whole `unsafe fn` body once the body needs its own block: in
// edition 2021 `unsafe_op_in_unsafe_fn` is allow-by-default, which exempted this crate's hardest
