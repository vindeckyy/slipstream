//! The monitor-mirror display backend: stream a **physical** head the compositor already has,
//! instead of creating a virtual one. See `design/per-monitor-portal-capture.md`.
//!
//! It implements [`VirtualDisplay`] so it drops into the session machinery unchanged — but it
//! creates nothing, and that difference is load-bearing:
//!
//! * [`DisplayOwnership::External`] ("someone else's display, merely mirrored: no keep-alive, no
//!   topology, no reuse") is exactly the contract for a head we don't own, so the registry's
//!   pooling/linger/exclusive machinery passes it through. §7.1 of the design doc — never disable,
//!   re-position or "restore" a monitor the user is sitting in front of — holds *by construction*
//!   here rather than by everyone remembering it.
//! * `create()` ignores the requested [`Mode`]. A panel runs at the mode the user set; the client
//!   scales. Reconfiguring someone's physical display to match a phone would be the same class of
//!   rudeness as blanking it (§7.3).
//!
//! Selection is a **host-level pin** (`SLIPSTREAM_CAPTURE_MONITOR`), not a per-session choice —
//! the host-pinned decision of record (§5.3), which is also what makes the input anchor below
//! sound: one pin for the whole host, so the shared injector can't be re-aimed per session.
