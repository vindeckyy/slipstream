//! Physical-monitor enumeration — "what heads does this host actually have?".
//!
//! This is the read-only counterpart to the rest of this crate: everything else here *creates* and
//! owns virtual outputs, while this module only *reports* the heads the compositor already has, so
//! an operator can pin capture at one of them (`SLIPSTREAM_CAPTURE_MONITOR`) and the console can
//! render a picker. See `design/per-monitor-portal-capture.md` §5.1.
//!
//! It lives in ss-vdisplay because monitor enumeration is a **per-compositor** question and this
//! crate already speaks every one of those dialects — KWin's `kde_output_device_v2`, Mutter's
//! `DisplayConfig.GetCurrentState`, `swaymsg -t get_outputs`, `hyprctl -j monitors`. Each backend's
//! implementation sits beside the code that already talks to it; this module is the shared type and
//! the dispatch.
//!
//! **The geometry is the point.** `x`/`y` are what make a head *identifiable*: two monitors can
//! share a size (and then a size-keyed match is a coin flip — see `ss-inject`'s absolute-coordinate
//! region selection), but they can never share an origin in the compositor's global space.
