//! Host-lifetime **virtual-display registry** (design: `design/display-management.md` §3/§7): the
//! owner of the display lifecycle, so a display can outlive the session that created it (keep-alive)
//! and the management API can list + release kept displays.
//!
//! The registry uses a per-session **pool**, driven by the pure [`super::lifecycle`] machine. The
//! key enabling fact: KWin / Mutter / gamescope put their capture node on the *default* PipeWire
//! daemon (`VirtualOutput::remote_fd == None`), reachable by `node_id` alone — so keeping the
//! backend's keepalive alive keeps the node alive, and a reconnect just re-attaches a fresh PipeWire
//! consumer to the same `node_id`. No fd dup / re-open needed. wlroots (`remote_fd == Some`, the
//! sandboxed xdpw portal) can't be kept without re-opening the portal fd per attach, so it is passed
//! through unchanged (teardown-on-drop, today's behavior) until that fresh-portal-capture re-attach
//! lands — a runtime gate on `remote_fd.is_some()`.
//!
//! The ownership split: the session's capturer no longer owns the real keepalive — the registry does.
//! [`acquire`] hands the session a `VirtualOutput` whose `keepalive` is a lightweight, gen-stamped
//! `DisplayLease`; dropping it releases the registry refcount,
//! and the lifecycle machine decides linger / teardown. `capture_virtual_output`'s signature is
//! unchanged — it just holds a lease instead of the real keepalive.
