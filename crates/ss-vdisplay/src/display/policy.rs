//! Virtual-display **management policy** — the user-configurable behavior surface for how virtual
//! displays are created, kept alive, and arranged (design: `design/display-management.md`).
//!
//! This is the pure config layer that sits **above** the per-compositor [`VirtualDisplay`](super)
//! backends: a small set of orthogonal options ([`DisplayPolicy`]) with safe defaults and named
//! [`Preset`]s, persisted to `<config>/display-settings.json` and editable from the web console.
//! The lifecycle/registry that *acts* on this policy lands in later stages; **Stage 0** (this file
//! plus the mgmt endpoints) stands up the surface and wires the two behaviors the existing code can
//! already express - the Linux monitor linger and "make the streamed output the sole desktop"
//! topology - through it.
//!
//! Precedence, mirroring the GPU preference (`console preference > env pin > default`): a present,
//! valid `display-settings.json` (console-written) **wins**; when it is absent the host keeps its
//! historical env-knob / default behavior untouched ([`DisplayPolicyStore::configured`] returns
//! `None`, and every Stage-0 call site falls back to exactly what it did before). The policy is
//! read at each acquire/teardown (file state, not a startup-frozen env var), so a console change
//! applies to the next connect without a host restart.
//!
//! The pure logic here — preset expansion, [`DisplayPolicy::effective`], the [`KeepAlive`] linger
//! resolution — is unit-tested; the store adds file I/O around it (the `gpu.rs` discipline:
//! private dir, temp-write + atomic rename, in-memory rollback on a failed write).
