//! Host-lifetime virtual-display **ownership model** (Goal-1 §2.5). One reference-counted monitor
//! lifecycle, shared by both Windows backends (SudoVDA + ss-vdisplay) instead of the two verbatim-
//! duplicated `MGR: Mutex<Mgr>` globals each backend used to carry.
//!
//! [`VirtualDisplayManager`] owns the earned Idle/Active/Lingering refcount machine + the linger timer +
//! a **typed** [`OwnedHandle`] control device (no more raw `isize` smuggled across the pinger/linger
//! threads). The backend differences — the IOCTL protocol and the per-monitor REMOVE key — are the only
//! thing behind the [`VdisplayDriver`] seam; the state machine, the render-adapter pin decision, the
//! GDI/CCD glue (`ss_win_display::win_display`), and the generation-stamped [`MonitorLease`] are backend-neutral.
//!
//! It's a process-wide singleton ([`vdm`]) initialised once with the chosen backend's driver — the
//! host runs exactly one virtual-display backend per process. The session holds a [`MonitorLease`];
//! its `Drop` releases the refcount (a *stale* lease — its monitor was preempted + recreated under it —
//! is a no-op, so it can never tear down the live monitor).
