//! Windows virtual-display backend driving **ss-vdisplay** — slipstream's OWN IddCx Indirect Display
//! Driver (the clean-room replacement for SudoVDA). The Windows analogue of the Linux per-compositor
//! backends: [`create`](VirtualDisplay::create) adds a virtual monitor at the client's exact `WxH@Hz`
//! (the mode is baked into the ADD IOCTL — no EDID seeding), starts the mandatory watchdog ping, and
//! the returned [`VirtualOutput`]'s keepalive `Drop` removes it (RAII).
//!
//! Control surface: a device-interface-GUID + `CreateFileW` + `DeviceIoControl` IOCTL protocol, with
//! the wire contract OWNED by [`ss_driver_proto::control`] (versioned + `#[repr(C)] Pod` structs,
//! NOT the SudoVDA ABI). No DLL, no named pipe. See `design/windows-host-rewrite.md`.
//!
//! This is a faithful clone of [`super::sudovda`] (the shipping fallback) repointed at the new driver:
//! same reference-counted/lingering monitor lifecycle, same CCD isolation + active-mode forcing — those
//! backend-NEUTRAL helpers are REUSED from `sudovda` (a ss-vdisplay monitor's `target_id` is a real OS
//! target id, so the CCD/DXGI code works unchanged). Only the driver-specific bits (GUID, IOCTL codes,
//! request/reply structs, the version handshake) differ, per `ss_driver_proto`.

// Every `unsafe` block in this file carries a `// SAFETY:` proof; enforce it (unsafe-proof program).

    /// dark" backstop. Probed directly on .173 with only the LG TV connected, the preset returns
    /// **rc=31 ERROR_GEN_FAILURE** (`SDC_USE_DATABASE_CURRENT` returns 0), which reads like an
    /// inert backstop.
    ///
    /// On glass it is not, and this case is the measurement that settled it — active paths
    /// `1 -> (virtual up) 1 -> (after force-EXTEND) 2`:
    ///
    /// * With one connected display there is nothing to extend across, hence rc=31.
    /// * With the virtual present there are two, and the preset applies. Both real call sites run
    ///   in exactly that state — the restore fires BEFORE the REMOVE, so the virtual is still
    ///   there — so the backstop does work where it fires.
    /// * ⭐ It also caught the clone hazard live: the arriving virtual monitor did **not** get its
    ///   own active path (1 -> 1), only the forced EXTEND gave it one (-> 2). That is precisely the
    ///   "no distinct source -> no frames" case `force_extend_topology`'s own doc describes.
    ///
    /// ⚠️ Residual worth remembering rather than asserting: a restore that fails once the virtual
    /// is already gone is back to one connected display, where EXTEND returns 31 and cannot
    /// re-light anything.
    ///
    /// Reports the counts rather than pinning a topology — which answer is "correct" depends on the
    /// box. It does assert the desk is not left with zero active paths.
