//! Time-bounded child-process helpers.
//!
//! Every compositor query this crate makes shells out to a helper (`kscreen-doctor`, `systemctl`,
//! `pw-dump`, …), and most of them are *clients of the very thing being diagnosed*: `kscreen-doctor`
//! is a Wayland client, so against a wedged KWin it blocks in its own connect and **never returns**.
//! `Command::status()` / `Command::output()` have no timeout, so one hung helper pinned the calling
//! thread forever — and on the host that thread is the session's stream thread, whose only way to
//! end a session is to return. A stuck query therefore became a permanently stuck session.
//!
//! These wrappers bound the wait: poll for exit until the budget runs out, then kill the child and
//! report [`std::io::ErrorKind::TimedOut`], so callers see a plain "the helper failed" error and
//! take their existing failure path instead of hanging.
//!
//! What the budget bounds is the whole **process tree**, not just the process we spawned — see
//! [`tree`] for why that distinction is the entire difference on Windows.
