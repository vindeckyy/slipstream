//! In-process KDE output management (`kde_output_management_v2` + `kde_output_device_v2`).
//!
//! Topology — make the streamed output primary, disable the physical/bootstrap outputs, capture
//! their modes for restore, re-enable them on teardown, position the output — used to shell out to
//! `kscreen-doctor` (see [`super::kwin`]). But `kscreen-doctor` drives a *separate* stack:
//! libkscreen picks a backend and, depending on the setup, waits on the kscreen KDED module over
//! D-Bus. On a machine where THAT layer is wedged it blocks in its own connect and never returns —
//! a field report (Nobara, KWin 6.6.4) showed every topology `kscreen-doctor` timing out at its 5 s
//! budget, so the streamed output never became the desktop (`also_disabled=[]`) and bring-up took
//! ~26 s.
//!
//! The compositor's OWN Wayland is provably responsive on that same session — the host just created
//! a virtual output over it via `zkde_screencast` — so we drive `kde_output_management_v2` directly
//! over Wayland here, sidestepping whatever wedges the standalone tool. Every wait is time-bounded,
//! so a genuinely wedged compositor degrades to `handled = false` and the caller falls back to the
//! `kscreen-doctor` path rather than hanging.
//!
//! KWin advertises one `kde_output_device_v2` global per output (the classic model; verified live:
//! `kde_output_management_v2` v19, `kde_output_device_v2` v20 on KWin 6.6.4). We bind them all, read
//! each output's name / enabled / priority / current-mode size, then build a
//! `kde_output_configuration_v2` and `apply()` it, waiting for `applied` / `failed`.
