//! GNOME/Mutter virtual-display backend via Mutter's *direct* D-Bus APIs (the same path
//! gnome-remote-desktop uses for headless sessions — not the xdg portal, which needs an
//! interactive grant):
//!
//! 1. `org.gnome.Mutter.RemoteDesktop.CreateSession()` → a remote-desktop session (read its
//!    `SessionId`). The cast is anchored to it, and it's also the future input path.
//! 2. `org.gnome.Mutter.ScreenCast.CreateSession({"remote-desktop-session-id": id})`.
//! 3. `ScreenCast.Session.RecordVirtual({"cursor-mode": embedded})` → Mutter creates a **virtual
//!    monitor** and returns a Stream object.
//! 4. `RemoteDesktop.Session.Start()` → the Stream signals `PipeWireStreamAdded(node_id)`.
//!
//! The virtual monitor's *size* follows the PipeWire format negotiation — Mutter adapts it to
//! what the consumer asks for — so the client's exact WxH is plumbed into our consumer's format
//! pod as the preferred size ([`VirtualOutput::preferred_mode`]) rather than passed here.
//! Sessions die with the D-Bus connection, so a keepalive thread owns it (RAII teardown).
//!
//! Requires a running Mutter (`gnome-shell` session, or `gnome-shell --headless` for the
//! headless host) on the session bus. GNOME is detected via `XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP=GNOME` or
//! forced with `SLIPSTREAM_COMPOSITOR=mutter`.
//!
//! **Per-client scaling** (`identity` policy §5.4): GNOME persists per-monitor scale to
//! `monitors.xml` keyed by connector+vendor+product+**serial**, but Mutter mints a fresh serial
//! (`0x%.6x`, a per-shell counter) for every `RecordVirtual` monitor and the API offers no way to
//! pass a stable identity — so GNOME's own persistence can never rematch our virtual output. The
//! host persists the scale instead ([`identity::ScaleMap`](crate::identity), keyed per
//! client / per the policy): reapplied at connect via the mode's `preferred-scale` plus the
//! topology `ApplyMonitorsConfig`, and the user's mid-session changes are polled from
//! DisplayConfig and written back.
