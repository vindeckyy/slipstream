//! The physical head a gamescope session drives — the enumeration half of per-monitor capture.
//!
//! gamescope was originally written off here as "nested, therefore no physical heads of its own"
//! (`design/per-monitor-portal-capture.md` §2). That is true of a gamescope running *inside*
//! another compositor, and of the headless ones this crate spawns itself — but it is false for the
//! deployment most people actually stream from: a Bazzite/SteamOS **Game Mode session is the DRM
//! master**, driving the TV directly. On such a box the head exists, the operator can see it, and
//! refusing to list it meant the console's picker was permanently empty on exactly the hardware the
//! feature was asked for.
//!
//! So this module answers a narrow question — *is this gamescope on the DRM backend, and which
//! connector is it lighting?* — from two sources that need no cooperation from gamescope:
//!
//! * `/proc/<pid>/cmdline`, for the backend flag and `--prefer-output` (gamescope has no protocol
//!   that reports its own output; the [`gamescope_control`] extension only sets things), and
//! * `/sys/class/drm`, for which connectors are actually plugged in, plus each one's EDID.
//!
//! **Only the head gamescope drives is listed.** Mirroring here is an attach to gamescope's own
//! composited PipeWire node (see [`super::heads`]'s caller in `vdisplay::mirror`), so a connector
//! gamescope is *not* driving could never be streamed — offering it in a picker would be offering
//! something that cannot work.
