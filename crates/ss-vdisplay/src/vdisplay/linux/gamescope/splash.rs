//! The bare-spawn **splash client** — the reason a fresh headless gamescope delivers frames at all.
//!
//! gamescope only composites (and only on a composite pushes a buffer to its PipeWire capture
//! node) when a client paints. A dedicated Steam launch paints NOTHING for the whole Steam
//! bootstrap (no window maps until the gamepad UI's first frame) — so a fresh
//! spawn's capture negotiated a format, reached `Streaming`, and then starved: zero buffers, the
//! 10 s first-frame timeout, teardown — and every native-plane retry killed the half-booted Steam
//! and started from zero, while the GameStream plane died on its single wait (the "fresh gamescope
//! output never delivers frames" field failure; root-caused on-box 2026-07-27 with a raw pw_stream
//! probe: `sleep infinity` nested → 0 buffers ever, `vkcube` nested → 60/s immediately).
//!
//! This client runs INSIDE the spawned gamescope (the nested-command wrapper backgrounds it before
//! exec'ing the real app) and guarantees damage from the first second: a dark window with a subtle
//! breathing bar painted at ~2.5 Hz. Two gamescope focus facts, both live-proven on c31743d:
//!
//! * In `--steam` mode gamescope composites ONLY windows whose Steam appid is listed in the root
//!   window's `GAMESCOPECTRL_BASELAYER_APPID` property (a plain mapped+painting window — even
//!   vkcube — gets zero composites). So the splash declares itself as the Steam client UI
//!   (`STEAM_GAME=769`) and seeds the baselayer with that appid iff nobody has written it yet.
//!   When Steam finishes booting it rewrites the baselayer as part of launching the game, which
//!   hands composite focus to the real game window with no action on our side (verified: 2.5 Hz
//!   splash cadence → 60 Hz game cadence on the same capture stream, no gap).
//! * In plain (non-`--steam`) mode any mapped painting window composites; the atoms are inert.
//!
//! The splash never exits on its own while the session lives: after the game takes focus it keeps
//! painting unfocused (damage on an unfocused window schedules no composite — harmless), so if the
//! game's window briefly goes away (Steam updater closed, level-load window swap) and gamescope
//! re-focuses the splash, liveness returns instead of a frozen last frame. It dies with the session:
//! gamescope's reaper kills it at teardown, and any X error (the connection dropping) exits cleanly.
