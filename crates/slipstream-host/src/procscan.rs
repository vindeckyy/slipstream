//! Finding a launched game's processes, from the signals its store gave us
//! ([`crate::library::DetectSpec`]).
//!
//! Read-only by construction: the host enumerates processes and reads metadata it already has
//! permission to see. No ptrace, no injection, no handles held open. On Linux it looks only at
//! processes owned by its **own uid**; on Windows it runs as SYSTEM and therefore *can* see
//! everything, which makes the two rules below the load-bearing part rather than an afterthought.
//!
//! ### The two rules
//!
//! 1. **Never adopt a process that predates the launch.** A player may already have the game open
//!    when a session starts; treating that instance as "this session's game" would let a session end
//!    kill a process it never started. Candidates are filtered by start time against
//!    [`launch_stamp`], taken before anything spawns.
//! 2. **Never trust a bare pid.** Pids are recycled — aggressively so on Windows — and a lease can
//!    outlive its game by a grace window, so every remembered process carries its start time and is
//!    re-verified against it ([`Scanner::alive`]) before it is counted as running, or signalled.
//!
//! ### Per-OS implementations
//!
//! The two have nothing in common beyond that contract, so they are separate modules presenting the
//! same [`Scanner`] surface: `/proc` on Linux, a Toolhelp snapshot on Windows. Everything above the
//! scanner ([`crate::gamelease`]) is platform-neutral.
