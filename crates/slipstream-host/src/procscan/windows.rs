//! The Windows matcher: a Toolhelp snapshot plus each process's full image path.
//!
//! Contract and rules live in [`super`]. Two differences from the Linux side shape everything here:
//!
//! * **The host is SYSTEM**, so it can open essentially any process. That makes rule 1 (never adopt a
//!   process that predates the launch) load-bearing rather than a nicety — without it a scan would
//!   happily adopt a copy of the game the player started an hour ago, and a session ending could kill
//!   it.
//! * **There is no launch reaper and no readable environment.** Steam's `SteamLaunch AppId=` argv
//!   trick is Linux-only, and reading another process's environment block on Windows needs
//!   `NtQueryInformationProcess` against an undocumented layout — not something to build a
//!   game-killing decision on. So the recipe is the image path: exactly the game's executable, or any
//!   executable under its install directory. Every Windows store the library scans reports one or
//!   both ([`crate::library::DetectSpec`]).
