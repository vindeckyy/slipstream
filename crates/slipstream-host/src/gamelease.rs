//! The lifetime of a launched game, and the two behaviors bound to it
//! (design/session-game-lifetime.md).
//!
//! A session that launches a title takes a **lease** on the resulting game. The lease knows three
//! things the host previously had no way to know:
//!
//! * whether the game has actually started (as opposed to a launcher shim that exits immediately),
//! * when it exits — which ends the streaming session, so the client returns to its library
//!   instead of staring at a desktop,
//! * how to end it — so a session ending can take the game with it, when the operator asks for that.
//!
//! ### Why a lease rather than a pid
//!
//! Most stores never hand the host the game's process. `steam://rungameid/…`, Epic's launcher URI,
//! an AUMID activation and Playnite's `playnite://` all hand off to a launcher that starts the game
//! somewhere else entirely and exits. So a lease is defined by *how to recognize* the game
//! ([`crate::library::DetectSpec`]), not by a pid we happen to hold — and a lease we do hold a child
//! for ([`LeaseKind::Child`]) falls back to recognition the moment that child turns out to be a shim.
//!
//! ### Safety posture
//!
//! Ending a game is destructive: it can cost unsaved progress. Three rules bound it.
//!
//! 1. **Opt-in.** [`GameOnSessionEnd::Keep`] is the default; nothing is ever ended unless the
//!    operator asked ([`crate::session_settings`]).
//! 2. **Never a surprise on a network blip.** `Always` waits out a reconnect grace window before
//!    ending anything, and a reconnecting client re-adopts its lease.
//! 3. **Only ever this session's game.** Every pid is adopted only if it started *after* this
//!    session's launch, and re-verified against its start time before being signalled
//!    ([`crate::procscan`]) — so a pre-existing copy of the same game, or a recycled pid, is never
//!    touched.
