//! WASAPI virtual microphone (Windows) — the inverse of [`super::wasapi_cap`]. Windows has no
//! user-mode way to *create* a capture (microphone) endpoint, so we target an EXISTING virtual audio
//! device and write the client's decoded mic PCM into that device's **render** endpoint; the device's
//! **capture** endpoint then surfaces as a microphone that host apps can record from.
//!
//! The target comes from the [`audio_control::wire_now`] plan (recomputed on every open): VB-Audio
//! "CABLE Input" (bundled by the installer — the dedicated mic target), the Steam Streaming
//! Microphone, VoiceMeeter, or anything with "virtual" in the name; `SLIPSTREAM_MIC_DEVICE` overrides.
//! The plan reserves the mic target and points the desktop-audio loopback at a DIFFERENT endpoint, so
//! injecting here can never echo into the host→client audio stream (see
//! [`wiring_plan`](super::wiring_plan) for the precedence rules and the headless cable-only case).
//! If no candidate is present we auto-install the Steam Streaming audio pair (see
//! [`install_steam_audio_pair`]); failing that we return an error with install guidance and the
//! caller (the mic pump) retries with backoff — a cable that appears later (driver install finishing
//! after boot) is picked up without a host restart.
//!
//! **Liveness.** Any WASAPI error in the render loop (endpoint invalidated/removed, audio engine
//! restart) exits the worker thread, which flips the `alive` flag — [`VirtualMic::push`] then
//! returns `false` and the pump reopens (re-planning, so endpoint churn re-resolves). Before this
//! existed, the first device change silently killed mic passthrough for the rest of the host's life.
//!
//! `push` enqueues decoded interleaved-f32 PCM into a bounded ring (drop-oldest so mic latency
//! stays bounded — the bound follows the adaptive prime threshold, or the legacy ~120 ms until
//! the pump drives it); a dedicated COM-apartment thread renders it event-driven through a
//! jitter buffer (prime → hold → re-prime, see the render loop — clients arrive in bursts, the
//! device pulls per-period) whose prime depth the mic pump sets from measured uplink jitter
//! ([`VirtualMic::set_target_depth`]), filling silence when the client isn't talking. WASAPI
//! objects are `!Send`, so they live entirely on that thread (mirrors `WasapiLoopbackCapturer`).

// Every `unsafe` block in this file carries a `// SAFETY:` proof; enforce it.
