//! GPU clock / P-state hygiene for the Linux host — the "easy-scene p99" lever (host-latency
//! plan Tier 1B): the driver's adaptive P-state ramps clocks down between bursty encode frames,
//! so every frame re-pays a spin-up. This is NOT theoretical — measured on the 780M (VCN 4),
//! a 1440p HEVC encode takes ~4.4 ms/frame with the clocks hot (120 fps pacing) but ~8 ms/frame
//! at a 60 fps duty cycle: the sag doubles per-frame encode latency. So the pin is worth holding
//! only while a client is actively streaming: it is armed on the first live client and released
//! when the last one disconnects (refcounted across both streaming planes — see [`session_pin`]),
//! leaving the driver's idle power management alone the rest of the time.
//!
//! **AMD** (`SLIPSTREAM_PIN_CLOCKS=1`, root-gated by sysfs ownership): write `high` into each
//! amdgpu card's `power_dpm_force_performance_level` while a client is streaming, restoring the
//! prior value when the last client disconnects. Non-root gets EACCES → logged once with the
//! privilege recipe. Deliberately
//! opt-in: it defeats power management box-wide and is wrong on battery (Steam Deck!).
//!
//! **NVIDIA** — two independent halves, both no-ops off NVIDIA:
//!
//! 1. **`CudaNoStablePerfLimit` application profile** (no root needed): a CUDA/NVENC context
//!    clamps GeForce into the P2 performance state — reduced *memory* clock — for the process
//!    lifetime. NVIDIA's supported opt-out is an application profile keyed on the process name
//!    (shipped by default for `obs`/`Discord` since R595; the raw key `0x166c5e = 0` "should work
//!    with all supported driver versions" — NVIDIA engineer, open-gpu-kernel-modules#333). We drop
//!    a rule for `slipstream-host` into `~/.nv/nvidia-application-profiles-rc.d/`; the driver's
//!    user-space component reads it at load, so it takes effect when libcuda/libGL next
//!    initializes (usually this same run — we write before any GPU work — else the next host
//!    start). Opt out with `SLIPSTREAM_NV_PROFILE=0`. (Do NOT set `CUDA_DISABLE_PERF_BOOST` for the
//!    host — that's the other half of the driver knob: it stops the boost *to* P2; the profile
//!    lifts the cap *at* P2 so the process can reach P0.)
//!
//! 2. **GPU core-clock floor** (`SLIPSTREAM_PIN_CLOCKS=1`, opt-in; root-gated by the driver):
//!    `nvmlDeviceSetGpuLockedClocks(TDP, UNLIMITED)` floors the core clock at the TDP/base clock
//!    while leaving boost headroom — NVIDIA's own latency guidance is "raise the floor, don't pin
//!    the max" (locking above base just gets throttled; a max pin only burns idle watts). Non-root
//!    callers get `NVML_ERROR_NO_PERMISSION` — logged once with the privilege recipe, then the
//!    host runs unpinned. The pin is undone on drop (when the last client disconnects); after a
//!    crash it persists until driver reload/reboot, which the reset-before-pin on the next arm
//!    self-heals. Deliberately
//!    NOT default-on: it defeats idle downclocking for the whole box and is wrong on
//!    battery-powered hosts.
// Every `unsafe` block in this file carries a `// SAFETY:` proof; enforce it (unsafe-proof program).
