//! The GameStream control stream: an ENet host on UDP 47999. Moonlight connects this
//! BEFORE the video stream starts (`STAGE_CONTROL_STREAM_START` precedes
//! `STAGE_VIDEO_STREAM_START`), so it must be up or the whole connection aborts. It carries
//! input (mouse/keyboard/gamepad), keepalives, and QoS feedback.
//!
//! Sunshine-mode hosts (we advertise `state=SUNSHINE_SERVER_FREE`) make Moonlight encrypt the
//! control stream with AES-128-GCM under the `/launch` `rikey`, even though we negotiate no
//! media encryption. Wire framing (all little-endian):
//!
//! ```text
//!   u16 encType = 0x0001 | u16 length | u32 seq | [16-byte GCM tag] | ciphertext
//!   length = sizeof(seq) + 16 (tag) + plaintext
//! ```
//!
//! The GCM nonce depends on what Moonlight negotiated (`encryptControlMessage` in
//! moonlight-common-c). For `SS_ENC_CONTROL_V2` it is a 12-byte nonce with `seq` (LE) in bytes
//! [0..4] and `b"CC"` (client→host) at [10..12]. For the legacy path — which we hit, since we
//! advertise no encryption — it is a 16-byte nonce with only `iv[0] = seq & 0xff` and the rest
//! zero. The tag is prepended to the ciphertext; there is no AAD; the key is the forward
//! `hex::decode(rikey)`. We auto-detect the exact scheme via [`decrypt_control`] on the first
//! packet that authenticates, since GCM gives no partial credit.
//!
//! Runs on its own native thread for the host's lifetime.
