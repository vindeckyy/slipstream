//! Auth gate for the management API `/api/v1` routes: paired client cert (mTLS, from anywhere)

//! Three lanes, three authorities:

//! - **plugin token** (bearer, loopback) — the scripting runner's capability-limited credential:
//!   the admin surface MINUS hook registration and pairing administration
//!   ([`plugin_may_access`]).
//! - **admin token** (bearer, loopback) — everything.
