//! Host lifecycle event bus (scripting-and-hooks RFC §4, phase 0).
//!
//! A process-wide broadcast bus + bounded catch-up ring for **lifecycle events**: client
//! connect/disconnect, session and stream start/end, pairing decisions, virtual-display
//! create/release, library mutations, host start/stop. Fire sites on BOTH planes call
//! [`emit`]; consumers ([`EventBus::subscribe`]) get a ring-backed catch-up plus a live
//! tail — the shape `GET /api/v1/events` (SSE, phase 1) and the hook runner (phase 2)
//! consume. Until those land, the bus is host-internal.
//!
//! Design notes (mirrors [`crate::log_capture`], the shipped ring precedent):
//! - Events carry a monotonically increasing `seq` (1-based) and a wall-clock `ts_ms`.
//!   A consumer resumes with `since = last seen seq`; one that fell off the ring gets
//!   `dropped = true` and should resync via the REST snapshots.
//! - The wire shape is **versioned and additive-only** within a major ([`SCHEMA_VERSION`]):
//!   fields and kinds may be added, never removed or renamed. The JSON snapshot tests below
//!   are the review gate — a failing snapshot IS a schema change.
//! - **Payload hygiene: events never carry secrets** — no PINs, no tokens, no key material.
//!   Client names and fingerprints are fine (already exposed via the management API).
//! - Emission is fire-and-forget and cheap (a mutex push + a non-blocking broadcast send);
//!   nothing here sits in a streaming hot path. Slow consumers lag (`RecvError::Lagged`)
//!   rather than buffering unboundedly; the SSE layer disconnects them.
