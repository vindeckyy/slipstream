//! Script-facing **"a stream is live"** marker file.
//!
//! While one or more clients are actively streaming, the host maintains a small, shell-sourceable
//! file at `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/slipstream/stream`. It is created when the first session goes live and
//! removed when the last one ends, so a per-title launch script (a Steam launch-option wrapper, a
//! `.desktop` Exec, whatever) can branch on presence + read the negotiated mode:
//!
//! ```sh
//! #!/bin/sh
//! STATE="${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR:-/run/user/$(id -u)}/slipstream/stream"
//! if [ -f "$STATE" ]; then
//!     . "$STATE"          # sets PF_STREAM_WIDTH / _HEIGHT / _REFRESH …
//!     exec "$@"           # session already at the stream mode → run the game directly
//! fi
//! exec gamescope -W 5760 -H 1080 -f -- "$@"   # not streaming → local triple-head
//! ```
//!
//! ## Contract (stable — scripts depend on it)
//!
//! * The file EXISTS iff at least one client is actively streaming. Absence is the "no stream"
//!   signal; a script must treat a missing file as "not streaming", never error on it.
//! * It is a POSIX-`sh`-sourceable list of `KEY=value` lines — safe to `. "$file"`. Every value is
//!   either a bare integer or a single-quoted string with quotes/controls stripped, so sourcing can
//!   never inject or run anything. Keys are namespaced `PF_STREAM_*` so sourcing won't clobber a
//!   caller's `WIDTH`/`HEIGHT`.
//! * Keys only get ADDED across versions, never repurposed; `PF_STREAM_SCHEMA` bumps if an existing
//!   key's meaning ever changes. Current keys:
//!     - `PF_STREAM=1`            — presence flag (redundant with the file existing; handy in `env`)
//!     - `PF_STREAM_SCHEMA=1`     — format version
//!     - `PF_STREAM_WIDTH`        — negotiated width  (px)
//!     - `PF_STREAM_HEIGHT`       — negotiated height (px)
//!     - `PF_STREAM_REFRESH`      — negotiated refresh (Hz, integer)
//!     - `PF_STREAM_HDR`          — `1` if the session negotiated HDR, else `0`
//!     - `PF_STREAM_SESSIONS`     — number of clients currently streaming
//!     - `PF_STREAM_CLIENT`       — the primary (oldest live) client's name, single-quoted
//! * Writes are atomic (temp + `rename`), so a script that sources mid-update always sees a complete
//!   prior version, never a torn file.
//!
//! ## Semantics
//!
//! Both serving planes announce — the native slipstream/1 loop and the GameStream/Moonlight compat
//! plane — so a wrapper script behaves identically whichever client is connected. (Until 2026-07
//! only the native loop did, so a Moonlight session left the marker absent and every wrapper took
//! its "not streaming" branch mid-stream.)
//!
//! The marker reflects the **primary** session — the oldest still-live one — which is the single
//! mode a single-user host is at. With several concurrent clients at different modes there is only
//! one file, so `PF_STREAM_SESSIONS>1` is the script's cue that width/height/refresh describe just
//! one of them. The mode published is the one negotiated at session start; a mid-stream resize is
//! not currently re-published (gamescope — the main script consumer — can't live-resize anyway).
