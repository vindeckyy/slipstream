//! Plane-neutral live-session status for the management `/status` (web-console Dashboard) view.
//!
//! The GameStream media pipeline records its session in `AppState.{launch, stream, streaming}`
//! (consumed by RTSP/media), but the native slipstream/1 plane never touches `AppState` — by design
//! it is handed only the shared stats recorder ([`crate::native::serve`]). So a native session,
//! which is the DEFAULT plane (GameStream is opt-in, `--gamestream`), was invisible on the Dashboard:
//! `GET /status` reported `video_streaming: false` and no session/stream card while a client was
//! actively streaming (the Stats page worked because it shares the recorder — hence the confusing
//! "stats move but the dashboard says idle").
//!
//! This module is the small shared surface the native video loop ([`crate::native::virtual_stream`])
//! publishes a live snapshot to, keyed per session so CONCURRENT native sessions each get an entry
//! (the native server admits up to `max_sessions`, unbounded by default). The loop registers on
//! stream start and the returned [`LiveSessionGuard`] removes the entry on ANY scope exit (return,
//! `?`, panic — RAII). `/status` reads [`snapshot`]/[`count`]; the Dashboard's session-control
//! buttons reach a native session through [`stop_all`] (stop) and [`force_idr_all`] (request IDR),
//! so surfacing the session doesn't leave those buttons dead.
