//! `SessionPlan` — the per-session capture / topology / encoder decision, resolved **once** from
//! [`HostConfig`](crate::config) (+ the handshake-negotiated bit depth) into a typed, logged value.
//!
//! **Goal-1 stage 3** (`design/windows-host-rewrite.md` §2.2): before this, the Windows session decision was
//! re-derived at three call sites — the capture backend inside `capture::capture_virtual_output`, the
//! process topology in `native::should_use_helper`, and the encode backend in
//! `encode::windows_resolved_backend` — each reading [`config`](crate::config) independently, with no
//! single owner (the latent "capture and encode disagree on the backend" hazard, plan §2.4). `SessionPlan`
//! resolves them together, once, so the deployed path reads one typed artifact.
//!
//! Stage 3 routes the **capture** and **topology** decisions through the plan (see
//! `capture::capture_virtual_output` taking [`CaptureBackend`] in, and `virtual_stream` reading
//! [`SessionTopology`]). The **encoder** is resolved by `encode::windows_resolved_backend` (config-backed
//! and GPU-vendor cached since stage 2, so already a single source) and *recorded* here as
//! [`EncoderBackend`]. Threading `encoder`/`input_format` into the encoder + capturer opens — which
//! removes the `capture → encode::windows_resolved_backend()` back-reference recomputed in `dxgi.rs` —
//! is **stage 5**.
//!
//! The type is platform-neutral so it threads through the shared `virtual_stream`/`build_pipeline`
//! signatures. Linux virtual outputs still use the portal/PipeWire node, while existing-desktop
//! sessions can resolve to portal, wlroots, KMS, X11, or NvFBC through the same pipeline record.
