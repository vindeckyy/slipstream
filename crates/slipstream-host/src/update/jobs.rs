//! Apply-job bookkeeping: the in-memory job snapshot the console polls, and the two on-disk
//! records that let an update **report its own outcome across its own restart** (design §4.2,
//! plan U1.1):
//!
//! - the **intent record** (`update-intent.json`) — written just before anything irreversible
//!   (spawning the installer). It is the only witness once the installer kills this process.
//! - the **result record** (`update-result.json`) — the durable outcome of the *last* apply,
//!   written either by the failing stage itself or by boot-time reconciliation.
//!
//! Reconciliation ([`reconcile`]) runs once per boot: intent + running-the-target-version ⇒
//! success; intent + still the old version after the grace window ⇒ failure with the installer
//! log path attached; a fresh intent ⇒ the apply is still in flight (the installer may not have
//! stopped us yet). Pure over its inputs so every branch is table-testable.
