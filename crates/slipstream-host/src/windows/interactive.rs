//! Launch a process into the interactive user session from the SYSTEM host.
//!
//! The Windows host runs as a LocalSystem SCM service. To *launch* a game/launcher so it renders onto
//! the captured desktop — and so the user's protocol handlers (`HKCU\Software\Classes`), UWP/appx
//! activation, and each store's auth/entitlement context resolve — the process must run in the
//! interactive session under the **logged-in user's** token, not SYSTEM and not session 0.
//!
//! This is the standard `WTSGetActiveConsoleSessionId → WTSQueryUserToken → DuplicateTokenEx →
//! CreateProcessAsUserW(winsta0\\default)` primitive, used for the library launch path
//! ([`crate::library::launch_title`]).
//!
//! IMPORTANT — use the **user** token (`WTSQueryUserToken`), NOT a session-retargeted SYSTEM token
//! (the host-spawn in [`crate::service`] duplicates the SYSTEM token and only changes its session id;
//! that is correct for launching *our own* streamer, but a store launcher needs the real user's token
//! for activation + auth). The host process itself stays SYSTEM.

// Every `unsafe` block in this file carries a `// SAFETY:` proof; enforce it (unsafe-proof program).

// …and the proofs only cover the whole file once an `unsafe fn` body needs its own blocks: the
// workspace sets `unsafe_op_in_unsafe_fn` to `warn`, which is a ratchet, not a floor. This module is
// at zero, so hold it there — `merged_env_block`'s pointer walk is the one real contract here, and
