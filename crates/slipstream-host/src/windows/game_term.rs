//! Asking a game to close on Windows, and killing it if it won't.
//!
//! The two halves of [`crate::gamelease`]'s termination ladder that need Win32: post `WM_CLOSE` to the
//! game's windows, then `TerminateProcess` whatever ignored it. Kept out of `procscan` (read-only by
//! construction) and out of `gamelease` (platform-neutral orchestration).
//!
//! ### Why the desktop dance
//!
//! The polite half is the reason this module is not three lines. `EnumWindows` enumerates the windows
//! of the **calling thread's desktop** — and the host runs as SYSTEM. It is in the right *session*
//! (the supervisor launches it into the active interactive console session — see [`super::service`]),
//! but a SYSTEM process does not start on the interactive user's *desktop* within it, so the
//! enumeration sees none of their windows. Without first binding the thread to the input desktop
//! the enumeration comes back empty and the ladder silently degrades to killing every game outright,
//! which is exactly the unsaved-progress outcome the grace window exists to avoid.
//!
//! Same `OpenInputDesktop`/`SetThreadDesktop` pattern the input injector uses for `SendInput`
//! (`ss-inject`'s `sendinput.rs`), for the same reason: a UAC prompt, the lock screen or
//! Ctrl-Alt-Del swaps the input desktop out from under us.
