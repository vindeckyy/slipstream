//! Tray lifecycle: the one place that knows how to find, start, stop and check the per-user status
//! tray. Shared by the `tray` CLI subcommand and by post-update reconciliation
//! (`update::windows::relaunch_tray`).
//!
//! Why this exists at all: `slipstream-tray.exe` is a per-USER, per-SESSION GUI process with no
//! recovery path of its own. The HKLM `Run` value only fires at sign-in, and nothing in the product
//! restarts a tray that died — so anything that kills one (an upgrade's `StopTrays`, a crash) left
//! the operator without an icon until they signed out and back in.
//!
//! The launch has to cross a privilege boundary in one direction but not the other, so [`start`]
//! tries the session-crossing path first and falls back to a plain spawn:
//!
//! * **From the host service (SYSTEM)** — the tray must land in the active console session under
//!   the *logged-in user's* token, not SYSTEM's. That is
//!   [`crate::interactive::spawn_in_active_session`] (`WTSQueryUserToken` +
//!   `CreateProcessAsUserW`), and it needs `SE_TCB`, which only SYSTEM holds.
//! * **From an interactive shell** — the caller IS the user in the right session already, so
//!   `WTSQueryUserToken` fails (an administrator does not hold `SE_TCB` either) and a plain spawn
//!   is both sufficient and correct.
//!
//! Trying the privileged path and falling back on failure discriminates the two without a token
//! inspection, and without adding any `unsafe` to this crate.
