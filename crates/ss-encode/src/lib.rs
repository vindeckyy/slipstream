//! Hardware video encode (plan §7). Binds FFmpeg; never rewrites codecs. Low-latency preset,
//! B-frames off. The backend is per-GPU: NVENC on NVIDIA (`*_nvenc`, accepts `bgr0` and does
//! RGB→YUV on the GPU, so no host-side CSC) and VAAPI on AMD/Intel (`*_vaapi`; the CPU-input
//! fallback swscales RGB→NV12, the zero-copy path imports the capture dmabuf straight into a
//! VA surface). One [`Encoder`] trait, selected in [`open_video`]. Extracted into a subsystem crate
//! (plan §W6): depends on the shared frame vocabulary (`ss-frame`) + zero-copy plumbing
//! (`ss-zerocopy`), never on capture — the capture→encode edge is one-way.
// NOTE: no crate-wide `#![allow(dead_code)]`. It was inherited from the pre-extraction host crate
// root as scaffolding for backend paths defined ahead of the build that used them, but a census
// across every feature combination on both platforms found it was hiding exactly two items — so it
// bought nothing and blinded the crate to future rot. Genuinely test-only helpers carry
// `#[cfg(test)]` instead.
// Every unsafe block in this module tree carries a `// SAFETY:` proof; enforce it (unsafe-proof
// program). As a parent module this also covers the child modules (windows/linux backends).
