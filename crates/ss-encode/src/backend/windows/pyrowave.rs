//! PyroWave host encoder (Windows) — **separate-plane zero-copy D3D11→Vulkan** via pyrowave's own
//! compat device (design/pyrowave-windows-host-zerocopy.md). The opt-in wired-LAN intra-only wavelet
//! codec, the Windows twin of `backend/linux/pyrowave.rs`.
//!
//! Shape (deliberately minimal — no `ash`, no hand-rolled external-memory import): pyrowave owns its
//! OWN Vulkan device, selected by the render GPU's vendor/device-id
//! (`pyrowave_create_device_by_compat`). The capturer's CSC produces TWO SEPARATE D3D11 plane
//! textures — a full-res `R8` **Y** + a half-res `R8G8` **CbCr** (BT.709 limited, matching the Linux
//! `rgb2yuv.comp` layout the wavelet clients decode) — each shared to that device as an NT handle
//! (`VK_EXTERNAL_MEMORY_HANDLE_TYPE_D3D11_TEXTURE_BIT`) via `pyrowave_image_create`. Separate
//! single/two-component textures import reliably on NVIDIA at any size, unlike a single planar NV12
//! texture (the vendored interop test: "only very specific resource sizes"). A shared
//! D3D11/D3D12 fence — signalled by the capturer *after* the convert — is imported as a Vulkan
//! timeline semaphore (`pyrowave_sync_object_create`) so the wavelet read is ordered after the
//! D3D11 convert. `pyrowave_encoder_encode_gpu_synchronous` performs the acquire (waiting the fence
//! value), the encode, and the release in ONE pyrowave-owned submission, referencing the external
//! image with `VK_QUEUE_FAMILY_EXTERNAL`. The dangerous cross-API import (incl. the NVIDIA
//! video-layout workaround) stays entirely inside validated pyrowave/Granite. Every AU is a
//! keyframe; the AU/wire-chunk framing is the shared [`crate::pyrowave_wire`] helper (byte-identical
//! to Linux).
//!
//! The capture side (a BGRA→YUV CSC into two shareable plane textures + a shared fence, gated on the
//! pyrowave session flag) lives in `ss-capture` (`windows/idd_push.rs`); the CbCr plane + fence ride
//! the frame on [`ss_frame::dxgi::D3d11Frame::pyro`], the Y plane on `D3d11Frame::texture`.
// UNSAFE-LINT EXEMPTION (rationale + exit criteria: `unsafe_op_in_unsafe_fn` in the workspace
// Cargo.toml). This body is `pyrowave-sys` C-API plus D3D11/Vulkan interop calls almost line for
// line; narrowing it would add one `unsafe {}` plus one SAFETY comment per call that could only
// restate the signature. Clearing this file means DELETING the markers that carry no caller
// contract, not wrapping the calls — until then the lint is off HERE and enforced everywhere else.
