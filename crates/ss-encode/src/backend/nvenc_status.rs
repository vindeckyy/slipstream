//! Actionable explanations for `NVENCSTATUS` failures in the Linux direct-SDK NVENC backend.
//!
//! Every NVENC entry-point failure used to be annotated `(no NVIDIA GPU?)`, which actively misled
//! triage: the direct-NVENC path only loads on a machine that HAS an NVIDIA GPU, and the failure a
//! user actually hit — `NV_ENC_ERR_INVALID_VERSION` from a userspace/kernel driver version skew,
//! fixed by a reboot — has nothing to do with a missing GPU. This maps each status to what it really
//! means and what the operator should do, and folds that cause into the `anyhow::Error` at
//! construction, so every downstream `{e:#}` log (the encode-recovery loop, session teardown) says
//! the useful thing without extra plumbing.
//!
//! One status needs process state to explain honestly: the driver reports BOTH "your headers are
//! newer than my kernel module" and "I can no longer hand this process a session" as
//! `NV_ENC_ERR_INVALID_VERSION`. [`note_session_opened`] latches the fact that a session already
//! opened here, which tells the two apart — see [`explain`].
