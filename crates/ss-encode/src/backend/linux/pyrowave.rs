//! PyroWave host encoder (design/pyrowave-codec-plan.md §4.3) — the opt-in wired-LAN
//! ultra-low-latency codec. Intra-only CDF 9/7 wavelet, pure Vulkan compute via the vendored
//! `pyrowave-sys` C API; measured 0.15–0.5 ms GPU encode at 1080p–4K on the RTX 5070 Ti
//! (Phase-0 microbench), vs 1–2 ms NVENC retrieve — and every frame is a keyframe, so the
//! whole IDR/RFI recovery apparatus is structurally unnecessary.
//!
//! Shape: the encoder owns a private ash instance/device (any Vulkan-1.3 GPU — this backend is
//! deliberately vendor-agnostic) shared with pyrowave via `pyrowave_create_device`, which
//! requires the original `VkInstanceCreateInfo`/`VkDeviceCreateInfo` to stay alive for the
//! device's lifetime — [`DeviceHold`] pins them. Frames enter as capture dmabufs (imported with
//! explicit DRM modifiers, cached per buffer) or CPU RGB (staging upload); the shared
//! `rgb2yuv.comp` BT.709-limited CSC writes an R8 luma image + an RG8 chroma image, which
//! pyrowave samples directly (two-component images synthesize the Cb/Cr planes via R/G view
//! swizzles — the documented NV12-style hand-off). Encode records into OUR command buffer
//! (`pyrowave_device_set_command_buffer`), so ingest + CSC + encode ride one submission; the
//! synchronous fence wait per frame is sub-millisecond by design (that is the codec's whole
//! point — overlapping frames buys nothing at this speed).
//!
//! MVP wire mapping (§4.4): the frame packetizes as ONE pyrowave packet (boundary = buffer
//! size) and ships as an opaque AU through the normal FEC/packetizer path, `keyframe = true`
//! on every AU. NOTE: until Phase 2 lands `CODEC_PYROWAVE` negotiation + a client decoder,
//! no shipping client can decode this — the backend is reachable only via an explicit
//! `SLIPSTREAM_ENCODER=pyrowave` and logs that loudly.
// UNSAFE-LINT EXEMPTION (rationale + exit criteria: `unsafe_op_in_unsafe_fn` in the workspace
// Cargo.toml). This body is `pyrowave-sys` C-API and ash/Vulkan compute calls almost line for line;
// narrowing it would add one `unsafe {}` plus one SAFETY comment per call that could only restate
// the signature. Clearing this file means DELETING the markers that carry no caller contract, not
// wrapping the calls — until then the lint is off HERE and enforced everywhere else.
#![allow(unsafe_op_in_unsafe_fn)]

// Every unsafe block in this module carries a `// SAFETY:` proof (parent module enforces it).
