//! Shared libav ownership helpers for the hardware decoders (`video_vaapi`, `video_vulkan`,
//! `video_d3d11`).
//!
//! The host has its own copy of this in `ss-encode`'s `enc/libav.rs`. The two crates do not depend
//! on each other — host encode and client decode share no code path — and the client's copy needs
//! something the host's does not ([`AvBuffer::into_raw`], for the decoder contexts that take
//! ownership of our ref), so a shared crate would have to carry an ffmpeg dependency and both sets
//! of semantics to save ~20 lines. It is not worth the edge.
