//! Video decode: reassembled HEVC access units → frames for the presenter.
//!
//! Three backends, picked at session start. Linux uses VAAPI → Vulkan → software on desktop
//! Mesa, and Vulkan first on NVIDIA/VanGogh.
//! Override: `SLIPSTREAM_DECODER=vulkan|vaapi|software`.
//!
//! * **Vulkan Video**: FFmpeg's Vulkan decoder running on the PRESENTER's own VkDevice
//!   (its handles arrive via [`VulkanDecodeDevice`]) — the decoded VkImage feeds the
//!   presenter's CSC pass directly, zero copy, every vendor with the video extensions
//!   (NVIDIA's only hardware path; measured 4K@144 with 0.1 ms decode).
//! * **VAAPI** (Intel/AMD fallback): libavcodec hwaccel; each frame is mapped to a
//!   DRM-PRIME dmabuf (`av_hwframe_map`, zero copy) and handed over as fds + plane
//!   layout for the presenter's Vulkan import. NVIDIA has no usable VAAPI
//!   (nvidia-vaapi-driver is broken for this — Moonlight blacklists it); device
//!   creation fails there. A mid-session error falls back — the host's IDR/RFI
//!   recovery resynchronizes.
//! * **Software**: libavcodec on the CPU + swscale to RGBA (staging upload).
//!   Slice threading only — frame threading would add a frame of latency per thread.
//!
//! Both run `AV_CODEC_FLAG_LOW_DELAY`; the host encodes zero-reorder streams (no
//! B-frames, in-band parameter sets on every IDR), so decode is strictly one-in/one-out.
//!
// Bindgen's C-enum representation can differ from ash's, so the explicit casts below are
// retained even when a particular build treats one of them as a no-op.
