//! App-lifetime gamepad service over SDL3 (mirrors the Swift client's `GamepadManager` +
//! `GamepadCapture`/`GamepadFeedback`).
//!
//! One worker thread owns SDL for the process lifetime: it tracks connected pads for the
//! Settings UI (metadata only — see below), selects the ONE controller forwarded as pad 0
//! (the user pin — persisted in Settings by stable `vid:pid:name` key — else the most
//! recently connected real pad; Steam Input's virtual pad is skipped), and — while a
//! session is attached — forwards buttons/axes, DualSense touchpad contacts and motion
//! samples (0xCC), and renders feedback: rumble, lightbar via SDL, and on a real DualSense
//! the raw effects packet (adaptive-trigger blocks replayed verbatim, player LEDs). Held
//! state is zeroed on the wire when the active pad switches or the session detaches, so
//! nothing sticks down.
//!
//! **Idle means hands off the hardware.** Outside an attached session the worker never
//! opens a device and keeps SDL's Valve HIDAPI drivers disabled ([`set_valve_hidapi`]):
//! the Steam Deck driver clears the built-in controller's "lizard mode" (trackpad-mouse,
//! clicky pads) the moment the device *enumerates* and keeps feeding that watchdog — so an
//! idle host-list window would kill the Deck's system input. The pad list for Settings is
//! built from SDL's ID-based metadata getters, which need no open.
//!
//! **Menu mode is the one idle exception.** The gamepad library launcher (`--browse`)
//! flips [`GamepadService::set_menu_mode`] on for its lifetime: the worker then holds the
//! active pad open and translates its buttons/stick into [`MenuEvent`]s (polled off the
//! open handle each loop — Apple `GamepadMenuInput` parity: edge-triggered buttons,
//! snapshot-on-entry so a button still held from a previous screen or stream can't ghost-
//! fire, stick/dpad direction with initial-delay auto-repeat). The Valve HIDAPI drivers
//! stay OFF — a plain SDL open of the virtual X360 / evdev pad doesn't touch lizard mode —
//! and an attached session always supersedes menu translation (the stream path is
//! untouched); detach re-snapshots so the escape chord that ended the session fires
//! nothing in the menu.
//!
//! This thread is also the single consumer of the rumble and HID-output pull planes.
