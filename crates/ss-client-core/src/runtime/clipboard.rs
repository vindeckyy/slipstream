//! OS-clipboard bridge for the spawned session client (`design/clipboard-and-file-transfer.md`
//! §5). The protocol half already exists in `slipstream_core::clipboard` — the per-session task
//! that runs fetch streams — and `NativeClient` exposes it as `clip_control` / `clip_offer` /
//! `clip_fetch` / `clip_serve` / `next_clip`. What was missing on Windows is exactly what §5.2
//! writes in Swift for macOS: the code that talks to the actual pasteboard. This is that half.
//!
//! Shape (one thread, owned by the session pump):
//!
//! * **Local → remote** stays lazy by construction. A poll of `GetClipboardSequenceNumber`
//!   spots a local copy, we announce the FORMAT LIST (`clip_offer`) and nothing else; the
//!   bytes are read only if the host actually pastes and sends a `FetchRequest`.
//! * **Remote → local** is EAGER in this first cut, and that is a deliberate deviation from
//!   §5.2's promise-based apply. macOS gets laziness free from `NSPasteboardItemDataProvider`;
//!   the Windows equivalent is delayed rendering (`SetClipboardData(fmt, NULL)` answered on
//!   `WM_RENDERFORMAT`), which needs a clipboard-owning window running its own message pump —
//!   a bigger piece than this. So we fetch on the offer and place real bytes, under
//!   [`EAGER_FETCH_CAP`] so a huge host-side copy can't pull megabytes nobody pastes. Text is
//!   tiny and always crosses; a large image simply isn't mirrored until delayed rendering lands.
//! * **Echo suppression** is §3.4's Windows rule verbatim: record the clipboard sequence
//!   number right after our own `SetClipboardData` and ignore exactly that change, or every
//!   copy ping-pongs between the two machines forever.
//!
//! Secrets are respected: a clipboard carrying `ExcludeClipboardContentFromMonitorProcessing`
//! (what password managers set) is never announced and never served — the Windows counterpart
//! of §5.2's `org.nspasteboard.ConcealedType` skip.
