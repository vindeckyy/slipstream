//! The brain layer: what a connect *is*, and the one implementation of how it runs
//! (design/client-architecture-split.md §3).
//!
//! Wake-then-connect exists three times today — GTK's `WakeConnect`/`wake_fallback`, the
//! WinUI shell's `wake_and_connect`, Apple's `HostWaker` (whose comment in the Windows copy
//! literally says "mirrors the Apple HostWaker") — and the deep-link and profile work would
//! have made it five. This module is where that collapses: a [`ConnectPlan`] is built from a
//! card click, a CLI verb or a URL (one constructor each, one type out), and the orchestrator
//! runs it. Front-ends render; they don't decide.
//!
//! The split that keeps this honest is [`UiDelegate`]: prompts, progress and error surfaces
//! stay in the front-end, because a GTK dialog, a WinUI page, a Skia console screen and a
//! terminal prompt genuinely are different things — but *when* to prompt, *how long* to wait
//! for a sleeping box and *what counts as a refusal* are decided here, once.
//!
//! Wake timings are Apple's `HostWaker` verbatim, because it is the implementation that got
//! them right: a magic packet is fire-and-forget and a cold box takes 20–60 s to POST, boot
//! and re-advertise — far longer than any dial will sit — so the packet is re-sent every 6 s
//! (a single one gets missed, and some NICs only wake on a fresh packet after dropping into a
//! deeper sleep state), presence is polled once a second, and the whole wait is bounded at
//! 90 s, after which it PARKS for retry rather than erroring out from under the user.
