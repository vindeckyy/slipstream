//! Windows display-topology helpers (plan §W6), extracted from the host's `windows/{win_display,
//! monitor_devnode,display_events}.rs` so the IDD-push capturer (`ss-capture`) and the ss-vdisplay
//! backend (the host) depend on them as a leaf PEER instead of the capturer reaching back into the
//! orchestrator. Windows-only; compiles to an empty lib elsewhere.
//!
//! - [`win_display`]: CCD/GDI path activation, mode-setting, HDR advanced-colour toggles, and the
//!   source-desktop geometry the capturer duplicates.
//! - [`monitor_devnode`]: PnP monitor devnode enable/disable (the parallel-display isolation lever).
//! - [`display_events`]: the `WM_DISPLAYCHANGE` / device-arrival watch that lets a capture stall say
//!   whether an OS display event coincided with it.

// `win_display` has denied both unsafe-proof lints since its CCD helpers stopped being `unsafe fn`;
// hoist that to the crate root so the smaller modules (`input_desktop`, `monitor_devnode`,
// `display_events`) and any future one are covered by default rather than by remembering to opt in.
