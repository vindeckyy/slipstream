//! Make display-config writes follow the INPUT desktop.
//!
//! Windows refuses `ChangeDisplaySettingsEx` / `SetDisplayConfig` issued from a thread that is not
//! on the desktop currently receiving input. While a UAC consent prompt (or the lock / logon
//! screen) is up, the input desktop is `Winlogon`; a host thread sitting on `WinSta0\Default` — the
//! desktop the service explicitly launches it onto — then gets `DISP_CHANGE_FAILED` /
//! `ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED` for EVERY write. A session starting in that window can never set its
//! virtual display's mode, so the capturer sizes its ring to a stale mode, every composed frame is
//! dropped for a size mismatch, and the client sits on a black screen until bring-up runs out of
//! retries. Field-reported 2026-07-23: a consent prompt left up on an unattended host made the box
//! unreachable until someone walked over to it.
//!
//! Measured on-glass that same day (RTX 4090 box, SYSTEM host in console session 2, a real
//! interactive consent prompt up, virtual display `\\.\DISPLAY42` active):
//!
//! ```text
//! INPUT desktop = Winlogon
//! UNBOUND  CDS_TEST      -> -1 (DISP_CHANGE_FAILED)      <- the field failure, reproduced
//! UNBOUND  SDC_VALIDATE  -> 0x5 (ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED)    <- the field failure, reproduced
//! bound thread desktop -> Winlogon
//! BOUND    CDS_TEST      ->  0 (DISP_CHANGE_SUCCESSFUL)
//! BOUND    SDC_VALIDATE  -> 0x0 (ERROR_SUCCESS)
//! ```
//!
//! The retry model mirrors `ss-inject`'s `sendinput.rs`: do NOT pay
//! `OpenInputDesktop`/`SetThreadDesktop` on every write — issue the write, and only when it fails
//! the way a wrong-desktop write fails do we rebind and retry once. That keeps the normal path
//! byte-for-byte as it was (a working write is never touched) and makes this strictly additive.
//!
//! Unlike sendinput's injector — a dedicated thread that KEEPS its binding — these helpers run on
//! shared/task threads, so the binding here is SCOPED: [`InputDesktopBinding`] restores the
//! thread's original desktop on drop. A thread left bound to a `Winlogon` desktop that is later
//! destroyed (prompt dismissed) would fail every subsequent display write for the life of the
//! process — the exact wedge this module exists to remove, so it must not be introduced here.
