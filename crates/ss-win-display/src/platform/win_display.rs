//! Backend-neutral Windows display utilities — the CCD (QueryDisplayConfig) + GDI helpers shared by the
//! virtual-display backends (ss-vdisplay, SudoVDA) and the capturers (IDD-push, WGC, DDA): GDI-name
//! resolution, advanced-color (HDR) get/set, active-mode set, and CCD topology isolate/restore.
//!
//! These are display-utility, NOT SudoVDA-specific (a ss-vdisplay monitor's target_id is a real OS target
//! id, so they operate identically), so they live here rather than in the SudoVDA backend — breaking the
//! circular reach-in where the capturers + the ss-vdisplay backend reached into `vdisplay::sudovda` for
//! them, which let the SudoVDA backend be dropped without losing them (audit §9 / Goal 2 — done). The
//! plan's `windows/display_ccd.rs`. Extracted verbatim from the former SudoVDA backend before its removal.

// Every `unsafe` block in this file carries a `// SAFETY:` proof; enforce it (unsafe-proof program).
#![deny(clippy::undocumented_unsafe_blocks)]
// …and that program only covers a whole `unsafe fn` body once the body needs its own block: in
// edition 2021 `unsafe_op_in_unsafe_fn` is allow-by-default, which exempted every CCD/GDI helper
// below — including `restore_displays_ccd`, the call ss-vdisplay's teardown path depends on to give
// the operator their physical panels back.
#![deny(unsafe_op_in_unsafe_fn)]
// The CCD/GDI helpers below are SAFE fns. They were `unsafe fn` for a decade of habit rather than a
// memory-safety obligation: every one takes `Copy` scalars or borrowed Rust data, returns owned
// values, and discharges its own FFI preconditions internally (`retry_set_display_config` even binds
// the input desktop itself). What their `# Safety` sections actually described — "call under the
// manager `state` lock" — is a SERIALIZATION requirement: calling one unlocked races the topology
// mutator and yields a stale answer, which is a correctness bug, not undefined behaviour.
//
// Encoding that with `unsafe fn` cost ~55 `unsafe` blocks across three crates whose proofs could
// only restate "this takes a u32 and returns a String", which is how `unsafe` stopped meaning
// anything here. The requirement is now prose on the functions that have it, and `unsafe` marks
// only the FFI calls inside.

// THE CCD CONTRACT, stated once — most `// SAFETY:` proofs below are an instance of it.
//
// `GetDisplayConfigBufferSizes(flags, &mut np, &mut nm)` writes the counts the OS wants for the
// given flags. `QueryDisplayConfig(flags, &mut np, paths, &mut nm, modes, None)` then fills those
// two buffers and writes back the counts it actually used, which are <= the ones asked for. Every
// call site here allocates `paths`/`modes` with EXACTLY `np`/`nm` elements immediately after the
// sizing call and passes `as_mut_ptr()` alongside the same `&mut np`/`&mut nm` it sized from — so
// the pointer and its count can never disagree, and the OS cannot write past either buffer. The
// `Vec`s are locals that outlive the call; the API retains neither pointer (both are synchronous,
// and the trailing `None` is the optional topology-id out-param). The `.truncate(np)/.truncate(nm)`
// that usually follows is a correctness step, not a safety one.
//
// Two obligations the compiler cannot see, and every caller here meets:
//   * These are FFI, so a torn `DISPLAYCONFIG_*` array would be UB — but the arrays only ever come
//     from `QueryDisplayConfig` itself, or from a `SavedConfig` this module produced earlier.
//   * `SetDisplayConfig` writes global OS state. The callers serialise it under ss-vdisplay's
//     manager `state` lock (each fn's prose doc says so), and `input_desktop::retry_set_display_config`
//     binds it to the input desktop, which is the one precondition a caller could otherwise get wrong.
//
// UNION READS, also stated once. Two `DISPLAYCONFIG` unions are read below and they justify
// differently:
//   * `sourceInfo/targetInfo.Anonymous.modeInfoIdx` (and `…_ADVANCED_COLOR_INFO.Anonymous.value`)
//     overlay a `u32` with a same-sized bitfield struct. BOTH variants are POD with no invalid bit
//     patterns, so the read is well-defined whichever one the OS wrote — there is no discriminant to
//     get wrong. The `modeInfoIdx` it yields is then bounds-checked with `modes.get(idx)`, which is a
//     correctness step, not a safety one.
//   * `DISPLAYCONFIG_MODE_INFO.Anonymous.sourceMode` IS discriminated — by the sibling `infoType`
//     field — so every read of it below is guarded by `infoType == DISPLAYCONFIG_MODE_INFO_TYPE_SOURCE`
//     on the same `DISPLAYCONFIG_MODE_INFO`. That guard is the proof; if one ever moves away from its
//     read, the union access stops being justified even though it still compiles.
