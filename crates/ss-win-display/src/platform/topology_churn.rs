//! Cross-crate "topology churn in flight" latch (stall-immunity program): the exclusive-topology
//! reassert watchdog (ss-vdisplay's manager) announces that it is evicting/restoring displays, and
//! the IDD-push capturer's descriptor follower (ss-capture) defers acting on descriptor changes
//! while the window is open.
//!
//! Why: the reassert's forced re-commit transiently bounces the virtual display's mode — the
//! descriptor poller can sample the EVICTION state (field log 2026-07-27 10:30:44Z: `hdr=true` →
//! `hdr=false` → recreate → recovery restores `hdr=true` → second recreate). Every descriptor
//! sampled inside the window is potentially that transient, and acting on it recreates the ring at
//! a mode the recovery chain is about to undo. The deliberate recovery rebuild
//! (`recreate_ring_in_place`, keyed off the reassert generation) is NOT affected — only the
//! passive descriptor-following is.
//!
//! Deadline semantics, not a flag: a `hold()` self-expires, so a holder that dies mid-churn (or a
//! release lost to a teardown race) can never wedge descriptor-following off forever. `release()`
//! just expires the deadline early on the watchdog's "stable again" observation.
