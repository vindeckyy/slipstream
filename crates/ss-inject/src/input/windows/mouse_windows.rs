//! Resident virtual HID mouse on Windows via the UMDF minidriver (`packaging/windows/drivers/ss-mouse`).
//!
//! **Why**: with no pointing device attached (a headless streaming box — no dongle), win32k reports
//! the cursor as absent (`GetSystemMetrics(SM_MOUSEPRESENT)` = 0) and DWM never composites a cursor
//! into the ss-vdisplay frame — the streamed desktop has an invisible pointer even though
//! `SendInput` moves it. Keeping ONE virtual HID mouse devnode alive for the host's lifetime makes
//! Windows always consider a pointer present and draw the cursor — the Sunshine/Parsec-class fix,
//! with zero client changes. Injection stays [`super::sendinput`]; the report path here is
//! exercised by `slipstream-host vmouse-spike` (on-glass validation) and is the future
//! higher-fidelity injection route.
//!
//! Transport is the **sealed pad channel** verbatim ([`PadChannel`],
//! `design/gamepad-channel-sealing.md`): an unnamed 64-B `MouseShm` DATA section the host
//! duplicates into the driver's WUDFHost, bootstrapped via the named `Global\pfmouse-boot-0`
//! mailbox. The devnode is `SwDeviceCreate`'d like a pad but held for the PROCESS lifetime (the
//! [`ensure_resident`] thread never drops it), so the pointer survives across sessions; it
//! disappears with the host service, which is exactly when nobody is streaming.
