//! Ask a devnode which process is serving it — the host half of
//! [`ss_driver_proto::gamepad::ChannelProof`].
//!
//! This is what the pad channel trusts instead of the bootstrap mailbox's `driver_pid`. The mailbox
//! has to be openable by LocalService (that is what the driver's own WUDFHost runs as), and the
//! delivery gate `verify_is_wudfhost` only checks that the named process's IMAGE is the system
//! `WUDFHost.exe` — which is world-executable. So through gamepad proto v2 any LocalService
//! principal, notably the deliberately de-privileged plugin runner, could spawn its own WUDFHost,
//! publish that pid, and be handed the pad's live DATA section: forged HID input into the interactive
//! desktop and a read of the remote user's controller state (security-review 2026-07-28).
//!
//! No host-side check could tell the two apart. Everything the real driver can read at LocalService —
//! the devnode's Location, its `Device Parameters` key, the object namespace — an attacker at
//! LocalService can read too, and both are session-0 LocalService processes running the same image,
//! so token, session and image checks all discriminate nothing. The one thing an attacker cannot
//! forge is **being the driver bound to the devnode we created**: I/O sent to that device reaches
//! only the driver PnP bound to it, and we look the device up by the instance id `SwDeviceCreate`
//! handed back, so a planted look-alike devnode is not in the running either.
//!
//! Three transports, one per driver shape — see [`ProofTransport`] for what each of them cost
//! and why the obvious ones did not survive contact with hidclass.
