//! Windows synthetic-pointer injection (design/pen-tablet-input.md §6): a per-session `PT_PEN`
//! device carrying the pen plane's full fidelity — pressure (rescaled to Windows' 0..1024),
//! polar tilt → tiltX/tiltY, barrel roll on `rotation` (0..359 — Windows Ink renders Pencil
//! Pro roll natively), barrel button, eraser (`PEN_FLAG_INVERTED`/`ERASER`), hover — plus a
//! `PT_TOUCH` device that closes the long-standing SendInput touch no-op for wire touches.
//!
//! Both follow Apollo's proven recipe (`design/apollo-comparison.md`): synthetic pointer state
//! goes STALE if not re-injected (~100 ms), so each device runs a small refresh thread that
//! re-asserts the last frame every [`REFRESH_MS`] while the pen is in range / contacts are
//! held — a stationary stylus must not hover-out (and a held finger must not auto-lift) just
//! because no new samples arrived. `CreateSyntheticPointerDevice` needs Win10 1809+;
//! [`crate::pen_supported`] probes it, so older hosts simply never advertise pen.
//!
//! Frame grouping mirrors the Linux uinput backend: a proximity-enter is injected together
//! with its position (never at a stale point), tip edges get their own DOWN/UP frames, and a
//! range-leave is a final frame without `INRANGE`.

// Every `unsafe` block in this file carries a `// SAFETY:` proof; enforce it.
