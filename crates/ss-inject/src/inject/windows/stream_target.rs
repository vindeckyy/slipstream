//! The streamed display every absolute coordinate maps into (design/pen-tablet-input.md field
//! fix). Pen, touch, and absolute-mouse positions arrive normalized to the STREAMED output's
//! frame, but the injectors historically mapped them over the whole virtual desktop — correct
//! only when the virtual display is the sole active display (Exclusive topology, normalized to
//! origin). In Extend — a physical monitor kept on beside the virtual output, or an Exclusive
//! isolate degraded to the keep-physicals fallback — the streamed output sits at a non-zero
//! origin, so every sample landed shifted and mis-scaled (the pen exposed it first: a stylus is
//! strictly absolute, with no closed-loop correction onto the target like a cursor).
//!
//! The host publishes the streamed output's CCD target id at capture bring-up
//! ([`set_stream_target`]); the mapping sites resolve its CURRENT desktop rect through
//! [`ss_win_display::win_display::source_desktop_rect`] — the same resolver the cursor-readback
//! poller maps frames with, so the two directions always agree — TTL-cached because a
//! group-layout re-arrange moves a live output's origin mid-session. With no target set, or none
//! resolved yet, mapping falls back to the whole virtual desktop: the historical behavior, still
//! correct for Exclusive topology and the client-less devtest paths.
