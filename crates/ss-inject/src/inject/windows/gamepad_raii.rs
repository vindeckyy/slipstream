//! Per-pad Windows resource RAII + the **sealed gamepad channel** broker (DualSense / DualShock 4 /
//! XUSB backends).
//!
//! Each virtual pad owns three OS resources: the **unnamed** DATA section the `ss_gamepad`/`ss_xusb`
//! driver works against (`XusbShm`/`PadShm`), the tiny **named** bootstrap mailbox
//! (`ss_driver_proto::gamepad::PadBootstrap`) that hands the driver a duplicated handle to it, and the
//! `SwDeviceCreate`'d software devnode the driver loads on. [`Shm`] and [`SwDevice`] own the resources
//! with RAII; [`PadChannel`] owns the two sections plus the delivery handshake.
//!
//! **Why the channel is sealed** (`design/gamepad-channel-sealing.md`): the DATA section used to be a
//! `Global\pf…-shm-<index>` named section with an SY+LS DACL, which let any *sibling LocalService*
//! process open it by name to read the live controller input or inject/forge input and rumble — the
//! same name-open vector the frame ring closed (`design/idd-push-security.md`). The DATA section is now
//! UNNAMED with a SYSTEM-only DACL and reaches the driver exclusively as a handle this host duplicated
//! into its WUDFHost (a duplicated handle carries the source's access, so no LS ACE is needed). The pad
//! drivers are UMDF HID minidrivers with **no control device** (hidclass owns the stack), so unlike the
//! frame channel there is no IOCTL to deliver the handle or learn the WUDFHost pid — hence the
//! late-bound [`PadBootstrap`] mailbox handshake, the one *named* object left.
//!
//! **What the mailbox is worth to an attacker** (corrected, security-review 2026-07-28). It carries
//! pids and a handle VALUE, and a handle value IS meaningless outside its process — but the mailbox
//! also *chooses that process*, and it is writable by LocalService (the SDDL the driver's WUDFHost
//! needs to open it by name). The delivery gate, [`ss_capture::verify_is_wudfhost`], authenticates an
//! IMAGE PATH, and `%SystemRoot%\System32\WUDFHost.exe` is world-executable: a LocalService principal
//! — the de-privileged plugin runner, or any other compromised LocalService service — can spawn its
//! own suspended WUDFHost, publish that pid, and be handed `SECTION_MAP_READ|WRITE` on this pad's DATA
//! section. That is forged HID input into the interactive desktop (the ss-mouse section drives a real
//! absolute pointer) and a read of the remote user's live controller state — so the earlier claim that
//! mailbox tampering "yields at worst a gamepad DoS, never a read or an injection" was wrong. (The
//! frame channel is NOT exposed this way: its WUDFHost pid arrives over the ss-vdisplay control
//! device, whose DACL is SYSTEM + Administrators.)
//!
//! **How v3 closes it.** The mailbox no longer decides anything. [`PadChannel::pump`] asks the
//! DEVNODE which process is serving it — [`channel_proof`], the host half of
//! `ss_driver_proto::gamepad::ChannelProof` — and duplicates into that answer. Only the driver PnP
//! actually bound to the device we `SwDeviceCreate`d can answer that device's I/O, and the lookup is
//! keyed by the instance id PnP handed back, so neither a spawned WUDFHost nor a planted look-alike
//! devnode is in the running. `driver_pid` survives as a liveness hint and nothing more; a tamperer
//! can still deny a pad, but denial was always available (squat the name) and is not what mattered.
//!
//! Two further rules make the state machine hold up around it:
//! * **One live target.** A delivery stands until its target process EXITS, judged on a retained
//!   `SYNCHRONIZE` handle so a recycled pid cannot fake it. UMDF's genuine
//!   restart-the-host-after-a-driver-crash path still re-attaches; nothing else displaces a live one.
//! * **No unproved delivery.** A pad with no `SwDeviceCreate` devnode (the out-of-band `devgen`
//!   bring-up path) has nothing to ask, so it refuses to deliver rather than fall back to the
//!   mailbox — unless an operator sets [`TRUST_MAILBOX_ENV`], which says so loudly in the log.
//!
//! What is NOT claimed: this authenticates the *devnode*, not the driver binary. An attacker who can
//! already replace the installed, signed driver package owns the endpoint by definition — that is the
//! same floor the frame channel accepts, and it sits above the SECURITY.md admin/SYSTEM boundary.
