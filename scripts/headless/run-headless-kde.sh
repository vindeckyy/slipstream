# Brings up the full desktop, not just the compositor, and waits for it to be *actually
# ready* before starting the portals/plasma — no blind `sleep`. A bare session is missing
# pieces a full Plasma login would start, so this also: exports the Xwayland DISPLAY (X11 apps
# like Steam need it), starts the polkit authentication agent (Discover/PackageKit need it to
# authorize installs), and supervises plasmashell (it draws wallpaper + panels; a crash must
# not leave the desktop gone). The env matters: without XDG_MENU_PREFIX=plasma- the launcher
# resolves ${XDG_MENU_PREFIX}applications.menu → "applications.menu", which doesn't exist on KDE
# installs (it ships plasma-applications.menu) — plasmashell runs fine but the menu is EMPTY.
