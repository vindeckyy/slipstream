# Re-vendors PyroWave (+ the minimal Granite subset it builds against) into
# crates/pyrowave-sys/vendor/pyrowave. Network access required; run manually,
# never from CI or build.rs (the flatpak/CI builders are offline — that is the
# whole reason the tree is committed).
#
# ⚠️ Bumping PYROWAVE_COMMIT is a protocol-affecting change: the PyroWave
# bitstream has no version field, so the CODEC_PYROWAVE wire bit means
# "PyroWave bitstream as of this pin" (design/pyrowave-codec-plan.md §4.2).
# A bump that changes the bitstream must bump the slipstream protocol version,
# and the Apple Metal hand-port (§4.7) must re-diff the two decode shaders +
# bitstream header structs.
