# slipstream — SteamOS post-OS-update self-heal (runs before slipstream-host at session start).
#
# The host binary links SteamOS system libraries (FFmpeg, PipeWire, libva, …). A SteamOS A/B
# update that bumps a soname leaves the binary unable to load — a silently dead host until
# someone remembers to re-run update.sh. This probe is the reliability backstop:
#   * healthy binary  → exit in milliseconds (every normal boot);
#   * loader breakage → run scripts/steamdeck/update.sh (rebuild host + web + runner against
#     the new library tree, restart services). The build container, source, and cargo caches
#     all live under /home, which SteamOS updates never touch — so the rebuild is warm.
#
# Root is NOT needed: the /etc system tuning survives updates via the atomic-update keep list
# (see slipstream-atomic-keep.conf); only the binary has to chase the OS libraries.

# systemd user units get a minimal PATH — distrobox commonly lives in ~/.local/bin.
