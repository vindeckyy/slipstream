#!/usr/bin/env bash
# slipstream — build the HDR-capable `slipstream-gamescope` for a SteamOS host (called by
# install.sh and update.sh; safe to run by hand).
#
# Stock gamescope offers no 10-bit PQ formats on its PipeWire capture node, so every session on
# the gamescope backend stays 8-bit SDR. This builds gamescope + slipstream's `pipewire-hdr`
# patches (the ONE canonical recipe, packaging/gamescope/build-slipstream-gamescope.sh) inside the
# same Debian-trixie distrobox the host is built in, installs it as
# ~/.local/bin/slipstream-gamescope, and pins the host to it via SLIPSTREAM_GAMESCOPE_BIN in
# host.env. HDR is on by default in the host; with this binary present a 10-bit-capable client
# streams true HDR10 from Game Mode.
#
# BEST-EFFORT BY DESIGN, mirroring the CI packaging paths: streaming works without it (sessions
# stay SDR), so a failure here warns loudly and exits 0 — it must never cost the host install or
# update it runs inside. The one hard rule is honesty at the seams: host.env points at the binary
# ONLY while `--version` proves it runs on SteamOS glass and carries the `+pfhdr` marker; on any
# failure both the binary and the host.env line are removed (a stale absolute override would
# otherwise break gamescope session spawning entirely, which is worse than SDR).
#
# The build clones gamescope fresh each run (submodules included). That costs bandwidth, but it
# only runs when the packaging/gamescope tree changed (pin bump, patch change — tracked by a
# content stamp) or the installed binary stopped working; a no-op re-run is milliseconds.
