# shellcheck shell=bash
# Run a command, retrying with linear backoff:  bash scripts/ci/retry.sh <attempts> <cmd> [args…]
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS: the runner box executes many jobs in parallel and its network drops
# packets under that load — observed as instant "[6] Could not resolve hostname" from
# flatpak/curl (dropped UDP DNS) and "dial tcp: i/o timeout" from the deploy steps
# (dropped TCP SYNs to github-actions), each seconds after other network calls in the same job
# succeeded. Tools with built-in mirror retries (dnf) ride it out; single-shot fetches
# (flatpak remote-add, rsync, ssh) killed the whole heavy flatpak build on one dropped
# packet. Wrap every single-shot network command in CI with this instead.
#
# Backoff is attempt*10s (10/20/30/…), so 5 attempts spread over ~1.5 min — long enough
# to outlive a load burst, short enough not to eat the job timeout. The wrapped command's
# stdout passes through untouched (safe for $(…) capture); retry chatter goes to stderr.
