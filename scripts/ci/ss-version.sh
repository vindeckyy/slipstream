# shellcheck shell=bash
# Single source of truth for slipstream release/canary version numbers (Linux + macOS runners).
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS: every release workflow used to hardcode a canary base version
# (`0.5.0`, `0.3`, …). Those magic numbers had to be hand-bumped on every stable release
# and nobody did — so canary channels silently fell *behind* stable (a canary showed up on
# TestFlight as 0.5.0 while 0.6.0 was already published). This script computes the base
# version DETERMINISTICALLY from the git tags instead, so there is nothing to hand-edit and
# no future agent can get it wrong.
#
# THE RULE (chosen 2026-07-03):
#   * stable  (a `vX.Y.Z` tag push) → PF_BASE = X.Y.Z (the tag, minus any -rc/+meta suffix).
#   * canary  (a main push)         → PF_BASE = <latest stable tag with minor+1, patch 0>.
#     i.e. latest release v0.6.0 → canary base 0.7.0. Cutting v0.7.0 auto-advances canary to
#     0.8.0. Canary is therefore ALWAYS exactly one minor ahead of the newest stable release.
#
# USAGE (bash workflows) — eval it, then format your channel's suffix off $PF_BASE:
#     eval "$(bash scripts/ci/ss-version.sh)"
#     case "$GITHUB_REF" in
#       refs/tags/v*) V="${GITHUB_REF_NAME#v}" ;;          # stable
#       *)            V="${PF_BASE}-ci${GITHUB_RUN_NUMBER}" ;;   # canary suffix is per-channel
#     esac
#
# It prints `KEY=VALUE` lines (eval-able) to stdout and — when $GITHUB_ENV is set — also
# appends them there for later steps. Exports:
#     PF_CHANNEL     stable | canary
#     PF_BASE        the base semver X.Y.Z (see THE RULE)
#     PF_MAJOR/MINOR/PATCH   the components of PF_BASE (numeric-version channels build
#                            `<MAJOR>.<MINOR>.<run>` from these — MSIX/decky need monotonic ints)
#     PF_STABLE_TAG  the latest stable release version the canary base was derived from (for logs)
#
# The pwsh twin scripts/ci/ss-version.ps1 implements the identical rule for the Windows runners.
