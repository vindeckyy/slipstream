  Rebuild the web mgmt console from the CURRENT web/ source and swap it into an installed host.

    powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\windows\build-web.ps1

  bun is both the build tool AND the runtime: vite.config's Nitro noExternals bundles every dep
  into the self-contained .output (no node_modules, nothing for bun to fail to resolve). The
  console runs as a supervised child of the SlipstreamHost service (bun {app}\web\.output\server\
  index.mjs on :47992), so the swap is: stop the service (its kill-on-close job takes the console's
  bun down and unlocks the files), replace {app}\web\.output, start the service - the supervisor
  brings the console back by itself. Needs an elevated shell (service control + Program Files).
