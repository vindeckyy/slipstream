rem slipstream web console launcher - the action the SlipstreamWeb scheduled task runs at boot.
rem
rem Lays out next to the installed payload: {app}\web\web-run.cmd, {app}\web\.output\... and
rem {app}\bun\bun.exe (so %~dp0 = {app}\web\). Auto-wires the console the same way the Linux
rem systemd unit does: it sources the host's mgmt bearer token + the console login password from
rem %ProgramData%\slipstream\, points the /api proxy at the host's loopback HTTPS mgmt API, and serves
rem the (self-contained, no-node_modules) Nitro console over HTTPS (HTTP/1.1 over TLS) on :3000 with the
rem bundled bun, using the host's OWN identity cert. No env editing.

rem The host's `serve` writes the mgmt token + its identity cert/key on first run. Until they exist
rem we have no credential and no TLS material, so WAIT rather than silently downgrading to plain HTTP.
rem
rem Wait in-process instead of exiting 1 and hoping the task's restart-on-failure retries: Task
rem Scheduler does not reliably restart on a plain non-zero exit code, so a console that started
rem before the host finished writing those files (the token lands at argument parse, the cert only
rem after the RSA-2048 keygen) used to stay down until the next reboot. ~5 min at 2 s, then give up
rem so a genuinely broken install still surfaces as a failed task rather than one that runs forever.
rem `timeout` needs a console this task does not have, so `ping -n 3` is the 2-second sleep.

rem Supervise bun instead of exiting with it. The task registers RestartCount=10/RestartInterval=PT1M,
rem but Task Scheduler honours restart-on-failure only when the action CRASHES or fails to start -
rem never for a plain non-zero exit - so before this loop any bun exit parked the console until the
rem next boot or interactive logon. Seen on glass 2026-07-30 (0.22.3 upgrade): `web setup` started the
rem task one second after the upgraded host service came up, bun exited at once (Last Run Result
rem 0xFFFFFFFF), and the console stayed down for hours on a box whose host was streaming perfectly -
rem which reads to the operator as "the host is gone". A single `schtasks /run /tn SlipstreamWeb`
rem revived it, i.e. whatever blocked the start was transient. That is exactly what a retry is for.
rem
rem Restart indefinitely for a console that served for a while and then died, but refuse to spin
rem forever on an install that can never work: PFFAILS counts only CONSECUTIVE fast exits and any run
rem lasting >= PFGOODSEC resets it, so a genuine crash-loop still surfaces as a failed task after
rem ~1 min of trying (the boot + logon triggers remain the outer backstop). Same shape as the Linux
rem unit's Restart= + StartLimitIntervalSec=0.
rem
rem INVARIANT for anything that STOPS the console (the installer's StopBunRuntimes, the host's
rem `stop_web_console`): end the TASK - `schtasks /end /tn SlipstreamWeb` / `Stop-ScheduledTask` -
rem which takes this launcher down with it. Killing bun.exe ALONE is now undone by the loop below,
rem which will relaunch it and re-lock the file you were trying to replace.

rem Unix seconds, for the uptime measurement above. Deliberately NOT parsed out of %TIME%: that is
rem locale-formatted - 12-hour locales append " PM" and many others use ',' as the decimal separator
rem - which makes hand-parsing it a portability trap in a launcher that ships worldwide. This runs
rem only after bun has already exited, so the ~0.3 s cost is irrelevant. `-Command` with an inline
rem expression is unaffected by a Restricted ExecutionPolicy (that gates script FILES). Should it
rem ever fail, PFN is empty, `set /a` reads that as 0, and the run is counted as a fast exit - the
rem conservative direction.
