// The typed management API for the Promise facade (RFC §7): every REST endpoint of the host as
// an autocompletable method with checked request/response types — named exactly as in the
// OpenAPI document (`listPairedClients`, `stopSession`, `reconcileProviderEntries`, …). This is
// the typed front door; `pf.request(method, path, body)` stays as the untyped escape hatch.
//
// It's a thin, zero-drift veneer over the generated client (`./gen/slipstream.ts`, from
// `@effect/openapi-generator`): the generated methods return Effects, so each is run to a Promise
// here. The transport is the SAME CA-pinning fetch the rest of the SDK uses (config.ts), fed to
// Effect's `HttpClient` via the overridable `FetchHttpClient.Fetch` reference — so the loopback
// pin is preserved and there is still exactly one place that knows how to reach the host.
