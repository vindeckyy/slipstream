// `Runtime.makeRunMain`, which runner-cli deliberately doesn't use), and a bun process whose only
// pending work is an unresolved promise busy-loops instead of blocking — so in the runner's own
// documented no-op state (no scripts, no plugins) it pinned a full core indefinitely until
// runner-cli started holding one idle handle. Measured against the real CLI rather than mocked:
// the regression is a property of the process, not of any function in it.
