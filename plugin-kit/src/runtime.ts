// The async-main boundary — the one place the two-effect-instances problem is handled.
//
// The packaged runner bundles its OWN copy of effect + the SDK; a plugin package's imports
// resolve to the plugin's node_modules. An Effect-shaped `main` would therefore hand the
// runner Effect values built by a different effect instance (Context.Tag identity is not
// shared across instances). The kit sidesteps this by construction: the plugin exports a
// plain async `main`, and EVERYTHING Effect happens inside a ManagedRuntime built from the
// plugin's own effect instance. Only the plain `pf` facade object crosses the boundary.
//
// Shutdown: the runner interrupts its supervision tree on SIGINT/SIGTERM, but it cannot
// cancel an in-flight promise — so the kit installs its own signal hooks, interrupts the
// plugin fiber (running scoped finalizers: UI deregistration, watcher close, cache flush)
// and bounds the whole teardown with `shutdownGraceMs` so `main` always resolves.
