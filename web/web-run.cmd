rem slipstream web console launcher - DEV layout (in-repo tree). The SlipstreamWeb scheduled task
rem (boot trigger, SYSTEM, restart-on-failure) runs this at startup. It sources the host's mgmt bearer
rem token + the console login password from %ProgramData%\slipstream\, points the /api proxy at the
rem host's loopback HTTPS mgmt API, and serves the self-contained (no-node_modules) Nitro console over
rem HTTPS (HTTP/1.1 over TLS) on :47992 with the host's identity cert. %~dp0 = <repo>\web\ .
rem
rem DEV vs the installed launcher (scripts\windows\web-run.cmd): the dev host service runs from
rem target\release (not the installed {app} tree), so this runs the in-repo web\.output. The console
rem now runs on bun (the Nitro `bun` preset + Bun.serve TLS entry), so set BUN
rem below to your bun.exe. Rebuild after a web change with `bun run build` in web\ ; no edit needed.
