rem slipstream web console launcher - DEV convenience, run BY HAND (in-repo tree). On an installed
rem host the SlipstreamHost service supervises the console itself (service.rs "web console child" -
rem no scheduled task, no launcher script); a dev host running from target\release has no installed
rem web payload next to its exe, so this script is how you serve the in-repo web\.output against it.
rem It sources the host's mgmt bearer token + the console login password from %ProgramData%\slipstream\,
rem points the /api proxy at the host's loopback HTTPS mgmt API, and serves the self-contained
rem (no-node_modules) Nitro console over HTTPS (HTTP/1.1 over TLS) on :47992 with the host's identity
rem cert. %~dp0 = <repo>\web\ . The console runs on bun (the Nitro `bun` preset + Bun.serve TLS
rem entry) - set BUN below to your bun.exe. Rebuild after a web change with `bun run build` in web\ .
