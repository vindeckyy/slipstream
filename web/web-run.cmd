rem slipstream web console launcher - DEV layout (in-repo tree). The SlipstreamWeb scheduled task
rem (boot trigger, SYSTEM, restart-on-failure) runs this at startup. It sources the host's mgmt bearer
rem token + the console login password from %ProgramData%\slipstream\, points the /api proxy at the
rem host's loopback HTTPS mgmt API, and runs the self-contained (no-node_modules) Nitro server on :3000.
rem %~dp0 = <repo>\web\ .

rem DEV vs the installed launcher (scripts\windows\web-run.cmd): the dev host service runs from
rem target\release (not the installed {app} tree), so this runs the in-repo web\.output with the
rem system node instead of {app}\bun\bun.exe + {app}\web\.output. Rebuild after a web change with
rem `bun run build` in web\ ; no edit needed here.
