// gate in the project is rate-limited, so this one is too.

// State is a module-level Map — it lives for the lifetime of the single Bun/Nitro server process,

// the socket peer IP (NOT a spoofable X-Forwarded-For — see the caller). The map is size-capped so a
// distinct-IP flood can't grow it without bound, and a global counter adds a mild floor so a
// botnet-style spread across many IPs still can't get unlimited aggregate guesses.
