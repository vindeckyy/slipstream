// GET /api/v1/events — the host's SSE lifecycle stream, proxied with the body left STREAMING.
//
// Why this route exists at all, when the `/api/**` catch-all already proxies everything:
// the generic path cannot stream. h3's `proxyRequest` pumps the upstream body into the node-style
// response with `res.write`, and under the deployed Bun entry that response is a `node-mock-http`
// object whose writes are accumulated and only turned into a real Response when the handler
// returns. Measured: three frames sent one second apart arrive at the browser together, ~3 s late,
// when the upstream closes. For an SSE stream that is fatal — it never closes, so nothing ever
// arrives, and every event-driven update in the console would silently never fire.
//
// Returning a WEB `Response` whose body is the upstream's own `ReadableStream` sidesteps the
// node-response emulation entirely: h3 hands it back as-is and the Bun entry passes it through.
//
// Everything else matches the catch-all: session-gated by middleware/auth.ts, mgmt bearer injected
// server-side, TLS relaxed only for the loopback hop, 401 → 502.
