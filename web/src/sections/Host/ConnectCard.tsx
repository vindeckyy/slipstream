 * "Get a device onto this host" — the address to type, and the deep link that skips typing it.
 *
 * The console knew the host's identity and local address all along and never offered either in a
 * form you could hand to a phone: pairing meant reading an IP off the Host page and retyping it on
 * a couch. `slipstream://connect/<unique_id>` is the shipped client grammar
 * (clients/shared/deeplink-vectors.json — the Rust, Swift and Kotlin parsers all test against it),
 * so a client that is already installed opens straight onto this host.
 *
 * No QR code: rendering one needs an encoder we do not bundle, and a wrong QR is worse than none.
 * The link is short enough to send over any chat app, which is what people actually do.
