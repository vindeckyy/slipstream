	 * game already waiting out its reconnect window has no session left to stop and is ended directly.
	 *
	 * Both paths are wider than the row they are attached to, and neither used to say so:
	 *
	 * - `DELETE /session` is the host's ONLY stop and it tears down every live session
	 *   (mgmt/session.rs calls `quit_session` AND `session_status::stop_all_quit`). With two people
	 *   streaming, "End now" on one row kicked both. There is no per-session stop to call instead,
	 *   so the honest fix is to name the blast radius before doing it.
	 * - `POST /game/end` with `app_id: null` means "end EVERY waiting game" to the host, and a grace
	 *   row for an operator-typed command carries no `app_id` — so that row ended all of them.
