// The host's event stream, wired to React Query's cache.
//
// The host publishes every lifecycle transition on `GET /api/v1/events` as SSE — client
// connect/disconnect, session and stream start/end, pairing decisions, display create/release,
// library/store/plugin changes, update availability, host start/stop. Nothing consumed it: the
// console learned about all of it by asking again on ten separate timers, so a change was up to
// 5 s stale, two pages could disagree with each other while you looked at them, and the Library
// page — which polls not at all — never noticed a newly installed game until a full reload.
//
// This subscribes once for the whole app and invalidates exactly the queries an event affects.
// It does NOT carry data into the cache: the REST snapshots stay the source of truth, and an event
// only says "this is stale now". That keeps the wire format additive-only (a kind we don't know
// costs us nothing) and means a missed event degrades to the polling behaviour we already had.
//
// Transport notes:
//   - Same-origin, so the sealed session cookie rides along and the BFF injects the mgmt bearer;
//     no auth work here. `EventSource` reconnects on its own and replays with `Last-Event-ID`,
//     which h3's proxy forwards, so a dropped connection resumes from the host's ring.
//   - The host sends a keep-alive comment every 15 s; the Bun entry's idle timeout is set above
//     that (nitro-entry/bun-https.mjs) so we don't sever our own stream.
//   - An `event: dropped` frame means we fell off the ring and must resync — invalidate everything.
