//! The shell↔session handoff: every stream runs in the spawned `slipstream-session`
//! Vulkan binary (the legacy in-process presenter is gone — phase 5 of
//! slipstream-planning `linux-client-rearchitecture.md`). What is left here is the
//! TRANSLATION: a [`ConnectRequest`] becomes a `ConnectPlan`, and the session's typed
//! lifecycle events become the [`AppMsg`]s the relm4 app consumes — spinner until
//! `{"ready":true}`, banner from the `{"error"|"ended": …}` line, exit code 3 +
//! `trust_rejected` routed to the re-pair PIN ceremony.
//!
//! Spawning, the argv, the stdout contract and the child handle live in
//! `pf_client_core::orchestrate` (design/client-architecture-split.md §3) — the WinUI shell
//! and the coming CLI spawn through the same code, so "what flags does a stream get" and
//! "what does ready mean" have exactly one answer.
