# slipstream — Android client (phone & TV)

The native **Android** app for streaming a slipstream host to your phone, tablet, or Android TV. A
Compose app that finds hosts on your network, pairs with a PIN, and streams at the display's own
resolution — with hardware HEVC decode, HDR10, and controller support, built for both touch and the
couch (D-pad / gamepad focus navigation).

## Features

- **Hardware decode** — NDK `AMediaCodec` HEVC → `SurfaceView`, including **HDR10** (Main10 /
  BT.2020 PQ), with low-latency tuning and a live stats HUD.
- **Audio both ways** — Opus + AAudio playback with a jitter ring, plus mic uplink to the host.
- **Controller support** — buttons + axes with rumble and HID feedback (lightbar / adaptive
  triggers); D-pad / gamepad focus navigation for TV and phone.
- **Find hosts automatically** — native mDNS discovery; first connect does a one-time **SPAKE2 PIN
  pairing** (or TOFU on trusted LANs), then reconnects on a Keystore-wrapped, pinned identity.
- **Compose UI** — Connect / Settings / Stream screens with Material You theming.

Built for `arm64-v8a` + `armeabi-v7a` + `x86_64` — the 32-bit `armeabi-v7a` slice is what keeps the
app installable on the many 32-bit Google TV / Android TV streamers (Walmart onn. 4K, Chromecast with
Google TV, budget Amlogic boxes) that otherwise reject a 64-bit-only build as "not compatible".

## How it's built — Rust-heavy

Kotlin can't `import` the cbindgen C header the way Swift can, so a native bridge is unavoidable. We
write it in **Rust** and link `slipstream-core` directly — so the Android client reuses the Linux
client's orchestration (audio jitter ring, VK keymap inverse, latency/skew math, capture state
machine, trust logic) instead of re-porting it into Kotlin.

| Side | Owns |
|------|------|
| **Rust** (`native/` → `libslipstream_android.so`) | the JNI seam, `NativeClient` (QUIC control + UDP data plane), AnnexB → `AMediaCodec` decode (incl. HDR10), Opus + AAudio audio + mic, controller feedback, latency math, trust/pairing, `mdns-sd` discovery |
| **Kotlin** (`app/`, `kit/`) | Compose UI, `SurfaceView` lifecycle, input capture, the Wi-Fi `MulticastLock` + permission UX, Keystore identity |

The single seam is `io.slipstream.kit.NativeBridge` ⇄ `Java_io_unom_slipstream_kit_NativeBridge_*`.

## Build & run

**Prerequisites:** Android SDK + **NDK r30** (`30.0.14904198`), `platforms;android-37.0`,
`build-tools;37.0.0`, **`cmake;3.22.1`** (builds libopus); **JDK 21** (AGP 9.2 runs on JDK 17–21, not
a newer default); Rust with `rustup target add aarch64-linux-android armv7-linux-androideabi x86_64-linux-android` and
`cargo install cargo-ndk`. Toolchain is pinned (AGP 9.2 · Gradle 9.4.1 · Kotlin 2.3.21 · Compose BOM
2026.05.01 · compileSdk 37 · minSdk 28).

**Android Studio:** open `clients/android` — it uses its bundled JBR 21, and the `cargoNdk*` task
builds the `.so` as part of the normal build.

**CLI** (point Gradle at JDK 21 if your machine default is newer):

```sh
export JAVA_HOME="$(/usr/libexec/java_home -v 21)"   # or your Temurin 21 path
cd clients/android
./gradlew :app:assembleDebug     # cargo-ndk cross-compiles libslipstream_android.so first
./gradlew :app:installDebug      # onto a running emulator/device
# emulators from env setup:  emulator -avd ss_phone   |   emulator -avd ss_tv
```

The debug APK lands in `app/build/outputs/apk/debug/`. Launch it, pick a host, pair, and stream.

### Signed sideload APK

Release builds use the same keystore as Play uploads. Keep the keystore outside the repository and
set the four `RELEASE_*` values from [.env.template](.env.template), or provide them as CI secrets.

```sh
cd clients/android
cp .env.template .env
# fill RELEASE_KEYSTORE_FILE, RELEASE_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD, RELEASE_KEY_ALIAS, RELEASE_KEY_PASSWORD
./gradlew :app:assembleRelease
adb install -r app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk
apksigner verify --verbose app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk
```

The release artifact is a universal signed APK containing `arm64-v8a`, `armeabi-v7a`, and
`x86_64`. CI publishes the signed APK as the `slipstream-android` artifact and keeps the canary and
stable sideload aliases separate from the Play bundle.
