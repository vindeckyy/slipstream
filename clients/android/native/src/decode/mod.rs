//! Android video decode (android-only): pull HEVC access units from the connector and render them
//! to the SurfaceView via NDK `AMediaCodec` — hardware decode, zero per-frame JNI.
//!
//! One-in/one-out: the host opens every stream with an IDR carrying VPS/SPS/PPS **in-band**, so the
//! decoder needs no out-of-band codec-specific data — we configure with mime + the negotiated
//! WxH (from [`NativeClient::mode`]) and feed each access unit as it arrives. The decode thread owns
//! the codec + window for its whole life; [`crate::session`] signals it to stop via the shared flag.
