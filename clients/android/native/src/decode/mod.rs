//! Android video decode (android-only): pull HEVC access units from the connector and render them
//! to the SurfaceView via NDK `AMediaCodec` — hardware decode, zero per-frame JNI.
//!
//! One-in/one-out: the host opens every stream with an IDR carrying VPS/SPS/PPS **in-band**, so the
//! decoder needs no out-of-band codec-specific data — we configure with mime + the negotiated
//! WxH (from [`NativeClient::mode`]) and feed each access unit as it arrives. The decode thread owns
//! the codec + window for its whole life; [`crate::session`] signals it to stop via the shared flag.

/// libavcodec path and Apple's VideoToolbox), while MediaCodec is pipelined — inputs and outputs
/// don't pair up, so "this AU produced no output" isn't a thing this loop can observe. A wall-clock
/// silence window is the same signal in the shape Android can measure.
///
/// Why it matters: the host opens a stream with an IDR and, under infinite GOP, sends no other one
/// unless asked. Miss that one — the decode thread only starts at `surfaceCreated`, so a slow TV box
/// can be handed the stream mid-GOP — and every later AU references a picture the decoder never had.
/// A hardware decoder doesn't error on that; it simply emits nothing. Without this backstop the
/// session sat there forever: AUs arriving, a healthy HUD, and a black surface, because nothing in
/// the Android loops ever asked for the keyframe that would re-anchor it.

/// receives nothing whatsoever. A decoder cannot be starved of output when it was handed no input,
/// so no signal in either loop fires, and the session sits connected — audio, input and the control
/// plane all alive — behind a black surface with a HUD reading `0 fps · 0.0 Mb/s`, which is exactly
/// how it comes back in reports (2026-07-30).
///
/// Asking costs one small control message, and it is the right ask in the case we can actually fix:
/// the host is encoding, but under infinite GOP every picture it sends references an IDR this client
