//! Android microphone uplink (android-only): capture mic PCM via AAudio (LowLatency **input**),
//! Opus-encode 10 ms mono frames, and push them to the host over the connector's mic plane
//! (`send_mic` → 0xCB datagram). The mirror of [`crate::audio`] in reverse: AAudio's realtime input
//! callback hands captured f32 to a channel; a worker thread we own does the Opus encode + send
//! (encoding is too heavy for the realtime callback, exactly as decode is on the playback side).
//! Like the playback path, the realtime callback is allocation-free: captured bursts are copied
//! into pre-allocated buffers from a recycle free-list (pool empty = drop the chunk, never
//! allocate on the capture thread). Format: 48 kHz **mono**, 10 ms, Opus VOIP with in-band FEC —
//! the host decodes any Opus frame ≤ 120 ms with its stereo decoder (mono packets upmix), so this
//! needs no protocol change; speech gains nothing from stereo, and the shorter frame shaves a
//! buffering interval off the uplink.
//!
//! **Mute** is a flag the encode loop reads per 10 ms frame, never a stream teardown: the AAudio
//! input stream, the input-preset ladder it settled on and its primed buffers all survive a
//! mute/unmute untouched, so toggling costs an atomic load and nothing else.
