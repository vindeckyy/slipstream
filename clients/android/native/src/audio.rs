//! Android audio playback (android-only): pull Opus packets from the connector, decode to
//! interleaved f32 (stereo or 5.1/7.1 surround), and feed AAudio (LowLatency) via its realtime data
//! callback through a jitter ring. Mirrors [`crate::decode`]: one thread we own (the Opus decode
//! producer) plus a shutdown flag; the realtime callback thread is owned by AAudio.
//!
//! The layout is the host-RESOLVED channel count (`NativeClient::audio_channels`, negotiated at
//! connect), so an older/clamping host that can only capture stereo is decoded + played as stereo.
//! 2 = stereo / 6 = 5.1 / 8 = 7.1, in the canonical wire order FL FR FC LFE RL RR SL SR.
//!
//! The ring started as a port of `slipstream-client-linux/src/audio.rs`, but AAudio — unlike
//! PipeWire, which adaptively rate-matches the stream and absorbs a shallow buffer — hands us a raw
//! realtime callback and makes us own the buffer. So this client diverges deliberately to stop the
//! Android-only crackle: (1) the callback is allocation/free-free — decoded buffers are recycled to
//! the producer via a free-list instead of being freed on the audio thread (Android's Scudo `free`
//! has unbounded tail latency); (2) the jitter ring is deeper (~40 ms prime / ~150 ms hard cap) and
//! decoupled from the tiny LowLatency burst size, with de-prime hysteresis so a transient drain
//! doesn't manufacture a silence; (3) the AAudio HW buffer is primed above its 2-burst default and
//! grown on XRuns (Google's anti-glitch technique).
