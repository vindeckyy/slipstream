/**
 * Keeps ONE window-insets reader alive for as long as the app's UI exists — the fix for the menus
 * coming back from a stream laid out against the WRONG safe area.
 *
 * Compose attaches its `OnApplyWindowInsets` and `WindowInsetsAnimation` callbacks when the first
 * composable reads an inset, and removes them again when the last reader goes away
 * (`WindowInsetsHolder.increment/decrementAccessors`). [StreamScreen] reads no insets at all — it's
 * a bare full-screen surface — so a stream drops the reader count to zero for its whole duration.
 *
 * That alone is survivable; what isn't is a session that ends while the app is BACKGROUNDED, which
 * is the common case (leaving the app ends the session — see StreamScreen's ON_STOP observer). The
 * whole window restore — `show(systemBars())`, releasing the landscape lock — then runs on a stopped
 * activity, and the corrected insets that follow arrive while Compose has no listener attached. When
 * the menus recompose, `incrementAccessors` re-attaches and asks for a fresh pass, but a stopped
 * window produces no dispatch, and on resume nothing has *changed* any more, so none ever comes.
 * Compose keeps serving what it last saw: the landscape, bars-hidden values.
 *
 * That's exactly what the reporter's phone showed (on-glass 2026-07-29, verified by dump): the
 * platform reported `bars=[0,162,0,72] cutout=[0,162,0,0]` for the window while the layout was still
 * using the landscape immersive set — cutout `left=162` (Material3 lays out against
 * `systemBars.union(displayCutout)`), bars all zero. Content shoved right by the landscape cutout,
 * nothing kept clear of the status bar or the gesture pill, and no rotation or IME animation could
 * shake it loose. A/B'd over eight runs of the real teardown sequence: 3 of 4 wrong without this,
 * 4 of 4 correct with it.
 *
 * Reading an inset here holds the count above zero for the activity's whole life, so the listeners
 * survive the stream and every dispatch lands. It subscribes to no inset VALUE (only the holder
 * object), so it triggers no recomposition — the cost is one DisposableEffect.
