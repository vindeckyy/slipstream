/**
 * Client settings profiles — named bundles of setting overrides applied on top of the global
 * [Settings] (design/client-settings-profiles.md §4). The Kotlin mirror of
 * `crates/ss-client-core/src/profiles.rs`; the model is the same on every client, so get it right
 * here rather than re-deciding it.
 *
 * A profile overrides only the fields the user touched; everything else keeps following the global
 * defaults **live**, so fixing a global once fixes it everywhere. That is why an overlay is sparse
 * nullable fields rather than a snapshot copy, and why a value is written on touch and cleared only
 * on an explicit "reset to default" — never by diffing against the current global at save time. A
 * stored value that happens to equal today's global is a legitimate *pin*: the profile keeps it
 * when the global later moves.
 *
 * Only tier-P settings are here. Device facts (which pad this device forwards, whether its console
 * UI is on) and host facts (clipboard sync, which lives on the host record) are deliberately absent
 * — see the design's §3 curation.
 *
 * Values are stored exactly as [SettingsStore] persists them — ints for the compositor/gamepad wire
 * bytes, enum names for the rest — so there is one encoding of a setting on this platform rather
 * than two. The catalog is client-local (v1 has no profile sync or export), so nothing else reads
 * it.
