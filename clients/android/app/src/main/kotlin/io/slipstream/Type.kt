// Geist — the slipstream brand typeface (the same family the website and the Apple client ship).
// Bundled as static OTF weights in res/font and applied to every Material 3 text style below, so the
// Android UI carries the brand type identically to the other clients. Geist Sans only — Geist Mono
// is intentionally not shipped (the licenses screen's technical block uses the platform monospace).
//
// Licensed under the SIL Open Font License 1.1 (see the Geist OFL entry in THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.txt).
