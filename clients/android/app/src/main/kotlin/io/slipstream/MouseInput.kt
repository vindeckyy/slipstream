 * Physical mouse → wire, in two modes (the iPadOS/desktop model):
 *  * **uncaptured** (default): hover/drag positions forward as absolute cursor moves
 *    (`MouseMoveAbs`, host-normalized against the window size) — desktop-style pointing. The
 *    local cursor is hidden over the stream (StreamScreen sets a TYPE_NULL pointer icon); the
 *    host's own cursor, composited into the video, is the one you see.
 *  * **captured**: the OS pointer is grabbed ([android.view.View.requestPointerCapture]) and raw
 *    relative deltas forward as `MouseMove` — FPS mouse-look. Engaged at stream start / by
 *    clicking into the stream when the "Capture pointer for games" setting is on, and toggled
 *    any time by Ctrl+Alt+Shift+Q (the cross-client chord). Focus loss releases it (the OS
 *    guarantees that); a click re-engages.
 *
 * Buttons ride [MotionEvent.ACTION_BUTTON_PRESS]/RELEASE edges (left/middle/right/back/forward →
 * wire 1/2/3/4/5), the wheel rides [MotionEvent.ACTION_SCROLL] with fractional accumulation so
 * high-resolution wheels don't lose sub-notch travel. Held buttons are tracked and flushed on
 * capture loss / stream exit so nothing sticks on the host. Events reach this class from
 * MainActivity's dispatch overrides (uncaptured) and the capture view's captured-pointer listener.
