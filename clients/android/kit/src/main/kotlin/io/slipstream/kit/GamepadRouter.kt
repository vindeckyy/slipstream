/**
 * Multi-controller router for one stream session — the Android analogue of the Linux client's gamepad
 * `Worker`/`Slot` model (`ss-client-core/src/gamepad.rs`) over the shared native-plane wire contract
 * (`slipstream-core/src/input.rs`). Each physical controller (Android `deviceId`) gets a STABLE
 * lowest-free wire pad index (0..15) held for its lifetime and freed only on disconnect, so a pad
 * dropping never renumbers the others (a game must not see its players shuffle). Every forwarded event
 * carries that pad index; a [NativeBridge.nativeSendGamepadArrival] declaring the pad's type is sent
 * once BEFORE its first input, a [NativeBridge.nativeSendGamepadRemove] on disconnect. Per-device axis
 * state lives in each slot's [Gamepad.AxisMapper] so a second controller can't clobber the first.
 * Feedback (rumble / HID) is routed BACK to the originating device by pad index via [deviceForPad].
 *
 * Selection: forward EVERY real controller (the Linux client's single-player pin has no Android UI
 * surface yet — Automatic is the only mode). Lifetime matches the session: constructed on stream
 * attach (opening a slot for every already-connected pad, so its Arrival lands before any input),
 * released on detach.
 *
 * A single controller lands on wire index 0, so its per-transition button/axis wire is byte-identical
 * to the old single-pad path (plus the Arrival/Remove declarations the contract requires — which an
 * older host simply ignores).
 *
 * Threading: slot mutation + dispatch run on the main thread (Android input dispatch and the
 * InputManager hot-plug callbacks both land there). [deviceForPad] is read from the feedback poll
 * threads, so the slot table is a [ConcurrentHashMap].
