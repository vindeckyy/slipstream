/**
 * USB transport for a Steam Controller 2 — wired (`28DE:1302`) or through the wireless Puck
 * dongle (`1304`/`1305`). The SC2 specialization of the shared [HidUsbLink] transport (which owns
 * the claim, read loop, write queue, and unplug handling); this class contributes only what is
 * SC2-specific:
 *
 * **The Puck claims ALL controller interfaces (2..5):** the dongle hosts up to four pads, one
 * HID interface each, and there is no way to know which slot a controller bonded to — claiming
 * only interface 2 read silence while Android's input stack kept the others (the round-2
 * on-glass symptom: the pad surfaced as a generic InputDevice → Xbox360). Whichever interface
 * streams state becomes the write target for rumble/settings.
 *
 * **Lizard keep-alive:** the firmware watchdog re-enables lizard mode (built-in kb/mouse
 * emulation) after a few seconds of silence, so [Sc2Device.DISABLE_LIZARD] +
 * [Sc2Device.NORMALIZE_JOYSTICKS] are re-sent on SDL's cadence — the generic link's keep-alive.
