// Stage-2 presenter orchestrator. GOAL ARCHITECTURE (the result of the 2026-07 pacing saga —
// read this before touching presentation):
//
//   net pump ──► VideoDecoder (VT async) ──► newest-wins 1-slot ring ──► RENDER THREAD ──► CAMetalLayer
//
// • The render thread is woken by FRAME ARRIVAL (the decoder callback signals it), never gated on
//   the display link: on macOS the WindowServer's damage tracking / FramePacing does not count our
//   out-of-band presents, so anything display-link-gated stalls exactly when the rest of the screen
//   goes quiet (adaptive-sync displays idle the link down). A decoded frame is always presented
//   promptly. The display link remains only as (a) a vsync CLOCK (phase + period, for the opt-in
//   V-Sync policy below), (b) a retry tick for a frame that couldn't get a drawable (`putBack`),
//   and (c) the iOS ProMotion rate hint.
// • The layer's own displaySyncEnabled stays FALSE on macOS — synced presents starve the drawable
//   pool outright (see MetalVideoPresenter's init for the post-mortem).
// • Present policy is a USER SETTING (DefaultsKey.vsync; SLIPSTREAM_PRESENT_MODE=immediate|vsync
//   overrides it for A/B), resolved once per session in start():
//     – V-Sync OFF (default): present immediately — lowest latency, the long-proven behavior.
//     – V-Sync ON: present(at: next vsync) predicted from the link's last phase/period, at most one
//       period ahead by construction, falling back to immediate when the link data is stale — a
//       schedule can never sit far in the future holding drawables hostage.
// • Present PACING is the stage-2/3/4 presenter split (`PresentPacing`, chosen per session by
//   SessionPresenter from the presenter setting / SLIPSTREAM_PRESENTER): stage-2 presents on
//   frame arrival; stage-3 additionally gates presents on the on-glass callback (`PresentGate`)
//   so the layer's FIFO image queue can never saturate; stage-4 (iOS/tvOS) presents into
//   CAMetalDisplayLink-vended drawables the moment a frame decodes — deadline pacing, where the
//   queue cannot exist at all — see PresentPacing's doc for the full rationale. Under deadline
//   pacing the render thread below is fed by BOTH the decoder callback and the link's per-refresh
//   updates (which vend the drawable), and the V-Sync policy/vsync clock don't apply.
// • Rendering lives on its own thread so any `nextDrawable()` wait lands off-main (input, SwiftUI).
//
// The render thread also stamps the unified latency stages (end-to-end capture→on-glass + decode and
// display stage terms — design/stats-unification.md). Mirrors StreamPump's lifecycle (one per start;
// cancel is permanent). SLIPSTREAM_PRESENT_DEBUG=1 prints per-second pacing stats (see
// PresentDebugStats).
//
// Threading: the pump runs on its own thread; the decoder callback on a VT thread; the render loop on
// the render thread; `renderTick` + `start`/`stop` on the MAIN thread (the view's CADisplayLink fires
// there). Only the ring (lock-guarded), the vsync clock (lock-guarded), and the decoder/presenter
// (internally locked / staged) cross threads.

///   one early burst (session start, a Wi-Fi clump) fills it to `maximumDrawableCount` and — with

///   ~2–3 refreshes of queue (the measured 23–30 ms display stage on 120 Hz ProMotion panels), and
///   the full-queue regime is where host↔panel clock drift turns into periodic repeats/drops (the
///   "fixed-interval" jitter reports).
/// - `glass` (stage-3; tvOS's default until the 2026-07 rebuild moved it to stage-4, now an
///   on-device A/B rung): at most a small BOUNDED number of presented-but-
///   undisplayed drawables in flight (`PresentGate`; depth 1 — see `SessionPresenter.gateDepth`
///   for why deeper is a regression). The render thread presents only while a gate slot is free
///   (a drawable's presented handler reopens its slot and re-signals); frames decoded meanwhile
///   coalesce in the newest-wins ring. Freshness is preserved by DROPPING stale frames before
///   present instead of queueing them behind the display — the hidden queue latency becomes
///   explicit, correct frame drops. The residual cost: presents serialize on the on-glass
///   callback, whose own delivery latency pushes each present ~a refresh past the frame's decode
///   (the field-measured 14 ms display stage at 120 Hz vs the ~half-refresh floor).
/// - `deadline` (stage-4, the iOS/iPadOS default; iOS/tvOS only — see
///   `PresenterChoice.explicit`): a CAMetalDisplayLink vends ONE drawable per refresh
///   (`preferredFrameLatency` 1) into a newest-wins hand-off slot, and the render thread pairs
///   it with the newest decoded frame THE MOMENT either half arrives — usually the frame, into
///   an already-vended drawable. The image queue cannot exist (one vended drawable in flight,
///   ever), nothing serializes on the on-glass callback (the link's next vend is the pace), and
///   the present is deadline-timed by the system to latch the upcoming refresh. This is the only

///   platforms; `arrival`/`glass` remain the on-device A/B rungs.
