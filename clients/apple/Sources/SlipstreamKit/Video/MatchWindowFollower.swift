// Match-window resize follower (design/midstream-resolution-resize.md D1/D2, client C3).
//
// The presenting view feeds this its PHYSICAL-PIXEL size on every layout; it debounces to
// resize-end, spaces requests ≥ 1 s apart, and asks the connection to switch the host's virtual
// display + encoder to match (`SlipstreamConnection.requestMode`) — so a windowed macOS session or
// an iPad Stage Manager / Split View scene streams native-resolution pixels instead of scaling.
// The decode/present side needs nothing: VideoToolbox recreates its session on the keyframe-derived
// format-description change (the first new-mode AU is an IDR with fresh parameter sets).
//
// The trigger discipline is the shared cross-client one (mirrors the session binary's
// `resize_decision`): physical pixels rounded DOWN to even (the host rejects odd dimensions) and
// clamped ≥ 320×200; debounce to resize-end; ≥ 1 s between requests; skip a size equal to the live
// mode; and request each distinct size at most once — which both stops re-asking a rejected size
// and keeps a host-side rollback (accepted, rebuild failed, corrective ack restored the old mode)
// from looping request → rollback → request.
