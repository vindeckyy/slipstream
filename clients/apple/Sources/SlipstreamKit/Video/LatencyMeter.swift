// Per-frame latency-stage sampler for the live HUD: records one interval per frame (an end

// pattern as the app's FrameMeter).

/// Samples one **latency stage** per frame and reports percentiles. One instance per stage of the
/// unified stats model (design/stats-unification.md):
///
/// - `host+network` = capture→received: `record(ptsNs:offsetNs:)` at AU receipt.
/// - `decode` = received→decoded and `display` = decoded→displayed: client-local single-clock
///   stages — `record(ptsNs:atNs:offsetNs:)` with the start instant as `ptsNs` and `offsetNs: 0`.
/// - `end-to-end` = capture→displayed, measured directly (never summed from the stages):
///   `record(ptsNs:atNs:offsetNs:)` at present.
///
/// For the host-anchored intervals (capture→…) the sample is `end + offset - pts_ns`, where
/// `pts_ns` is the host's capture wall clock (the AU's pts) and the connect-time **clock-skew
/// offset** (`SlipstreamConnection.clockOffsetNs`, host minus client) makes the difference valid
/// across machines. `offsetNs == 0` means an old host that didn't answer the skew handshake (or
/// genuinely synced clocks) — the number is then only meaningful same-host, and the HUD tags the
/// end-to-end line `(same-host clock)`.
