// Throttled host keyframe requests for decode recovery, shared by both pumps (StreamPump /
// Stage2Pipeline). Wedge signals arrive from several threads — the decoder's async error callback
// (a VT thread), a submit failure on the pump thread, the framesDropped poll — and the decode stays
// stalled for several frames until the requested IDR lands, so requests are coalesced (100 ms, the
// throttle the working Android path uses: fast enough that a lost recovery IDR is re-requested
// promptly, bounded so a sustained freeze can't flood the control stream). Bound to the live
// connection at pump start, unbound on stop.
