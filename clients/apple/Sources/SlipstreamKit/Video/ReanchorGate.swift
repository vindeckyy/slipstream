// Swift wrapper around the slipstream-core C ABI's post-loss re-anchor gate
// (`slipstream_reanchor_gate_*`, ABI v6). The shared Rust gate (crates/slipstream-core/src/reanchor.rs)
// is what the Linux desktop pump and the Android client use directly; the Swift clients reach
// it across the C ABI so the freeze-until-reanchor policy is defined ONCE for every platform.
//
// Why a freeze at all: after unrecoverable loss the host keeps sending delta frames that reference a
// picture the client never got. Hardware decoders (VideoToolbox included) don't reliably error on
// that — they CONCEAL, returning a gray/garbage frame with a success status. Presenting those is the
// visible "gray flash with motion" of the loss reports. The gate withholds concealed frames and holds
// the last good picture on glass until a PROVEN clean re-anchor lands — an IDR (wire `FLAG_SOF`), an
// RFI recovery anchor (`USER_FLAG_RECOVERY_ANCHOR`), or the 2nd of two intra-refresh recovery marks
// (`USER_FLAG_RECOVERY_POINT`) — with a bounded backstop so a lost re-anchor can never freeze forever.
// See slipstream-planning design/client-reanchor-freeze-parity.md.
//
// Threading: one gate per session. Its calls arrive from two threads — the pump thread (`arm` on a
// frame-index gap / a submit failure, `poll` per iteration) and a VideoToolbox decode thread
// (`onDecoded` per decoded frame, `onNoOutput` on a decode error). The raw Rust gate is a plain
// struct behind an opaque pointer with no internal synchronization, so every call is serialized under
// `lock` here — the calls are cheap field updates, so contention is negligible. `@unchecked Sendable`:
// the lock enforces the contract.
