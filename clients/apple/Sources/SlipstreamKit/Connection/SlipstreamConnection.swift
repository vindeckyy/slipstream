// Swift wrapper around the slipstream-core C ABI's slipstream/1 connection API.
//
// Threading contract (mirrors the C header): one SlipstreamConnection is pumped from a single
// video thread via nextAU(); nextAudio() runs on its own (single) drain thread, and
// nextRumble()/nextHidOutput() share one feedback drain thread (two core planes, one puller
// each — polling them sequentially from one thread is within the contract); the core keeps
// per-plane borrow slots, so the planes never alias. send() is enqueue-only and safe
// alongside all of them. The pointers inside an AU/audio packet are only valid until the
// next call of the same kind, so we copy into Data here — the copies are small and keep the
// Swift side memory-safe.
//
// Trust: pass the host's pinned certificate fingerprint (the host logs it at startup, and
// `hostFingerprint` reports what a trust-on-first-use connect observed — persist it, e.g.
// in UserDefaults keyed by host, and pin it from then on).
//
// close() is safe from any thread: it flags the pullers to exit at their next poll
// boundary, then takes the per-plane locks (each held across its blocking C poll), so the
// handle is never freed under an in-flight call — the C contract ("never close with a
// next_au/next_audio call in flight") is enforced here rather than left to callers. After
// close, the pull methods throw `.closed` and the threads unwind on their own.
