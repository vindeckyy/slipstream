// Game library client (experimental, plan step 3). Fetches the host's unified game library
// from the management REST API (`GET /api/v1/library`) — the same payload the web console's
// /library page renders. Read-only on the client for now; launching a chosen title is a later
// step. Gated behind `DefaultsKey.libraryEnabled` in the UI.
//
// The management API serves HTTPS on a port distinct from the slipstream/1 data plane (default
// 47990, also advertised in the host's mDNS `mgmt` TXT). A paired client is authorized for the
// read-only library route by its **mTLS certificate** — no bearer token. The host binds this read
// surface to the LAN by DEFAULT (the bearer-gated admin surface stays loopback-only), so a paired
// client browses a host's library with no operator step. This mirrors the GameEntry/Artwork/
// LaunchSpec schema in `crates/slipstream-host/src/library.rs`.
