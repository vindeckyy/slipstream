// The stats overlay's verbosity tier — a port of the Android client's 3-tier overlay semantics
// so the two clients feel identical: Off → Compact (one-line pill) → Normal (headline stats) →
// Detailed (plus the latency stage equation). Persisted under `DefaultsKey.statsVerbosity`;
// the in-stream cycle surfaces (⌃⌥⇧S, the three-finger tap) advance it with
// `store(current.next())`, and every UI reader observes the same default via @AppStorage.
//
// Lives in SlipstreamKit (not the app) because the kit's input paths (TouchMouse's three-finger
// tap, InputCapture's captured-state ⌃⌥⇧S) cycle it directly.
