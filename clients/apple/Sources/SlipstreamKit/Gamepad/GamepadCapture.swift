// Gamepad capture → slipstream/1 datagrams. Forwards EVERY controller GamepadManager selected —
// each on its own stable wire pad index (ss-client-core's slot model) — for the lifetime of a
// streaming session. One physical controller with no pin is player 0 (byte-identical to the old
// single-pad path); a pin forwards only that one, also as pad 0.
//
// Each forwarded controller gets a `Slot`: its open GC handlers plus the wire state (buttons,
// axes, touchpad fingers, motion throttle) for its pad index — isolated per device so two
// controllers never clobber each other. On connect a slot opens (GamepadArrival declares its
// kind, then input flows); on disconnect / pin change / stop it closes (held state flushed to
// rest on the wire, then GamepadRemove tells the host to tear the pad's virtual device down).
//
// The wire is incremental (one button/axis transition per 18-byte event, accumulated host-side
// into the virtual pad — see slipstream_core::input::gamepad), so we snapshot the full
// GCExtendedGamepad state on every valueChanged and diff against the previous snapshot. Sticks
// are ±32767 with +y = up (GC already matches, no flip), triggers 0...255. The core folds these
// per-pad transitions into idempotent, sequence-numbered snapshots keyed on the same pad index,
// so all this layer must get right is the index — one controller per slot, one slot per index.
//
// PlayStation-pad extras ride the rich-input plane (0xCC): touchpad contacts normalized
// 0...65535 (origin top-left, +y down — GC's ±1/+y-up is converted here) and motion samples in
// raw DualSense sensor units (gyro 20 LSB per deg/s, accel 10000 LSB per g — derived from the
// host's fixed calibration blob; the conversion lives in ONE place, `Wire`, so a live sign/scale
// correction is a one-line change). The host ignores both unless a pad's virtual device is a
// DualSense or DualShock 4 — both carry a touchpad and motion, so the capture below covers either
// (`GCDualShockGamepad` exposes the same `touchpad*` surface as `GCDualSenseGamepad`).
//
// Unlike mouse/keyboard capture, gamepad forwarding is NOT gated on the mouse-capture toggle — a
// controller can't click local UI, so it always drives the host while the app is active. On
// deactivation, controller switch, or stop, every held control is released on the wire (the host
// pad would otherwise stay stuck on the last state).
