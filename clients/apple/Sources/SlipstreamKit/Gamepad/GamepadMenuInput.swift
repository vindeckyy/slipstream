// Explicit left-stick/dpad-driven menu navigation for the gamepad UI's host carousel and library
// coverflow (iOS/iPadOS only — see GamepadUIEnvironment).
//
// Polls the active controller at 60 Hz rather than installing `valueChangedHandler`/
// `pressedChangedHandler` callbacks — mirroring `ControllerTestView`'s "Input" card (see its own
// comment: "Poll the live controller ... — no handlers installed"), the one thing in this codebase
// already confirmed on real hardware to read a controller reliably outside a streaming session. Two
// earlier versions of this class both installed handlers directly (first reading the dpad's combined
// `.xAxis`/`.yAxis`, then its discrete `.isPressed` states, matching `GamepadCapture`'s pattern) and
// neither one's callbacks fired on-device even though the SAME controller's input showed up correctly
// in `ControllerTestView`'s poll-based readout — so polling isn't just a style choice here, it's the
// only approach confirmed to actually work outside a stream. Being read-only, it also can't conflict
// with `GamepadCapture` installing its own handlers once a stream starts — there's nothing to hand
// off or race over.
//
// The button set mirrors a console launcher: A confirms, B backs out, Y is a screen's secondary
// action, X a tertiary one, and the shoulders (L1/R1) are optional fast "jump" steps. Directional
// moves auto-repeat on a held stick/dpad after an initial delay; every button is edge-triggered
// (fires once per press).
