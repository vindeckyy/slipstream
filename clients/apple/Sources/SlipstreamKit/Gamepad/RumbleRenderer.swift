/// Rumble → the active physical controller (CoreHaptics; a DualSense on macOS goes over raw HID

/// best-effort. The previous renderer drove infinite-duration players torn down and rebuilt per
/// wire update; one asynchronous `stop` dropped inside CoreHaptics left an unstoppable player
/// buzzing with its handle discarded, which no later (0,0) could reach — the "walked into the
/// menu and the rumble never stopped" bug.
///
/// The invariants that bound divergence now:
///  1. **No infinite events.** A motor plays finite `segmentSeconds` segments; while the level
///     holds, the successor is scheduled ON the engine timeline to start exactly when the
///     current segment expires (seamless — no stop/start race in steady state). A leaked player
///     therefore self-silences in ≤ `segmentSeconds`.
///  2. **Idempotent targets.** An update equal to the current target (the host re-sends rumble
///     state every 500 ms as its loss heal) is a liveness stamp, never a player rebuild.
///  3. **Zero is immediate, ramps are throttled.** (0,0) stops players the moment it lands;
///     nonzero→nonzero changes rebuild at most every `minRebakeSeconds` per motor (the ticker
///     lands the newest value once the window opens).
///  4. **Escalating stop.** A throwing `player.stop` means the engine's state is unknown — the
///     whole engine is stopped (silencing every player it hosts) and lazily rebuilt behind the
///     exponential backoff.
///  5. **Staleness watchdog** (`Policy.session`): audible with no wire command for
///     `sessionStaleSeconds` → force silence. A lost stop can outlive the host's 500 ms heal
///     only if the channel itself died, and then the pad must not buzz forever. `Policy.manual`
///     (the settings test panel) instead holds a level until it is changed.
///
/// Engines are created lazily on the first nonzero amplitude and torn down on retarget;
/// failures (pads without haptics, engine resets) downgrade to silence — rumble is best-effort
/// by design, but *staying silent* when told to stop is not.
