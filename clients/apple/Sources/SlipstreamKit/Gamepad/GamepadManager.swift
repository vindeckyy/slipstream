// Controller discovery + selection, app-lifetime. One GamepadManager (`.shared`) watches
// GCController connect/disconnect from launch, so the Settings page shows live controller
// state without a session, and the session components (GamepadCapture / GamepadFeedback)
// follow `forwarded` — every forwarded controller is streamed to the host, each on its own
// wire pad index (ss-client-core parity; up to `GamepadWire.maxPads`).
//
// Selection (mirrors ss-client-core's `forwarded_ids` + slot model): with no pin, EVERY
// extended controller is forwarded — each assigned a stable lowest-free pad index held for
// its forwarded lifetime, so a disconnect frees only its own index and never renumbers the
// others. A pin (Settings, persisted under DefaultsKey.gamepadID) forwards ONLY that one pad
// — an explicit single-player choice. `active` stays the single "primary" pad (the pinned
// one, else the most recently connected extended gamepad) that the Settings / launcher / menu
// UI reads. GCController has no stable hardware serial, so the pin is a fingerprint of
// vendorName|productCategory (+ a connect-order suffix for twins); identical twin controllers
// may swap a pin across reconnects, which the Settings footer documents.
//
// A singleton (not a SwiftUI environment object) because macOS shows Settings in its own
// `Settings{}` scene — there is no common ancestor view to inject from.
