// Whether the iOS/iPadOS/macOS UI should be in its controller-friendly mode (the console-style
// host launcher, gamepad settings, and the coverflow library browser instead of the touch/desktop
// layouts). A pure function, not a singleton: the reactivity comes from callers already observing
// `GamepadManager.shared` and the `DefaultsKey.gamepadUIEnabled` @AppStorage themselves (the same
// local-read pattern SettingsView already uses for GamepadManager), so this stays the single place
// the two combine without adding a second ObservableObject or an environment key nobody else needs.
