// The Siri Remote as a pointing device during a tvOS streaming session — the remote's touch
// surface drives the HOST cursor (relative deltas, like a laptop trackpad), a surface press
// clicks (left button), and Play/Pause right-clicks. It also owns the remote's DELIBERATE
// session exit: hold Back/Menu ≥ `disconnectHold`. A short Back press does nothing — the
// UIKit menu press it also generates is swallowed by ContentView's session branch, so neither
// a trackpad fumble nor a game-controller B press can end the session (the pad's exit is the
// L1+R1+Start+Select chord in GamepadCapture).
//
// The remote is read through GameController as a GCMicroGamepad with
// `reportsAbsoluteDpadValues = true`: the dpad axes then report the finger's ABSOLUTE position
// on the surface (±1, +y up) while touched, and snap to exactly (0, 0) on lift. Successive
// positions are differenced into relative mouse deltas; the exact-zero snap is treated as a
// lift (a real touch at the mathematical centre is measure-zero, and one dropped delta there
// is imperceptible). Handlers (not a poll) — the same in-session delivery GamepadCapture
// relies on.
//
// Lifecycle mirrors GamepadCapture: started by SessionModel when streaming begins (never
// during the trust prompt), stopped on disconnect; held buttons are released on stop so the
// host never keeps a stuck click.
