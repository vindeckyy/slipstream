// Input capture → slipstream/1 datagrams.
//
// Mouse MOTION and BUTTONS take different paths per platform. On macOS GCMouse's
// mouseMovedHandler/pressedChangedHandler proved unreliable in the field (delivered
// nothing on a live Mac while GCKeyboard worked — a documented GameController quirk), so
// macOS drives motion + buttons from NSEvent under cursor disassociation instead (fed by
// StreamLayerView, the same channel that already carries scroll), and the GCMouse motion/
// button handlers are not installed there. NSEvent deltas under
// CGAssociateMouseAndMouseCursorPosition(false) are the relative motion — OS-acceleration-
// applied (not raw HID), which is exactly what Moonlight's macOS client ships and is fine.
// iOS keeps the GCMouse path (raw deltas under pointer lock). GCKeyboard (both platforms)
// gives HID keycodes which we map to the Windows VK space the host's vk_to_evdev table
// consumes (same space Moonlight uses). Gamepads (GCController) come later — the host's
// uinput pads already speak the GamepadButton/GamepadAxis event kinds, but m3's injector
// path doesn't route them yet.
//
// The wire carries integer deltas; GC hands us Floats. We accumulate the fractional
// remainder per axis so slow, sub-pixel motion isn't truncated away.
//
// GC only delivers while the app is active, so anything held when focus leaves would
// stick down on the host forever — we track pressed keys/buttons and release them all on
// didResignActive and on stop(). All GC handlers and notifications fire on the main
// queue (the framework default), so the mutable state here needs no locking.
//
// Forwarding is gated by `forwarding` (driven by StreamLayerView's capture state): the
// handlers stay attached for the whole session, but while the user has released capture
// (⌃⌥⇧Q — the cross-client Ctrl+Alt+Shift+Q — or ⌘⎋, focus loss) nothing reaches the host
// and key events travel the responder chain normally. Everything held is flushed host-side
// on each transition to released.
//
// GCMouse.current/GCKeyboard.coalesced are process-global singletons with one handler
// slot each: only one InputCapture can be live per process. `activeCapture` tracks
// ownership so a stale capture's stop() can't clobber a newer one's handlers.
