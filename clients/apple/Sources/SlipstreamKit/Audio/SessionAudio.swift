// Session audio, both directions:
//
//   host → speaker: a drain thread pulls Opus packets (nextAudio, its own plane in the
//   core), decodes via OpusDecoder, and writes PCM into a jitter ring; an
//   AVAudioSourceNode pulls from the ring (silence on underrun with re-priming, so a
//   network gap costs one dip, not permanent crackle).
//
//   mic → host: a tap on the input node folds the capture to one mono bus (the chosen channel
//   of a multi-channel interface, or a sum of all channels), resamples to 48 kHz mono, slices
//   10 ms chunks, Opus-encodes, and sendMic()s each packet — the host feeds them into a
//   virtual PipeWire source.
//
// Engine topology. With the mic enabled and echo cancellation on (both defaults), BOTH
// directions run on ONE AVAudioEngine with the system voice processor engaged
// (`setVoiceProcessingEnabled`) — AEC needs render and capture on the same unit so it can
// subtract what the speaker is playing from what the mic hears; without it, a loudspeaker
// client feeds the host's own game audio straight back to it (the primary reported echo
// source). The voice processor can only follow the system DEFAULT devices, so explicit
// endpoint choices fall back to the old two-engine topology — see `wantsCombined` for the
// exact decision, and `startCapture` for why two engines handle arbitrary device pairs.
//
// Devices are chosen by UID ("" = system default: the engine is then never pinned to a
// concrete device and follows default-device changes).
