// iOS/iPadOS presenter: the same AVSampleBufferDisplayLayer + StreamPump as macOS,
// hosted in a UIViewController so the scene can pointer-lock (the iPadOS equivalent of
// the Mac's cursor capture — with a hardware mouse/trackpad the system cursor is hidden
// and GCMouse's raw deltas drive the host cursor alone; the system only honors the lock
// fullscreen-and-frontmost, so in Stage Manager it degrades to Mac-style "both cursors
// visible" forwarding).
//
// FINGER touch and INDIRECT POINTER (mouse/trackpad) are routed apart by UITouch.type.
// Direct fingers (and Pencil) always forward as wire touches — every finger maps to a touch
// id, coordinates mapped through the aspect-fit letterbox into host-mode pixels (surface ==
// host mode, so the host's rescale is the identity).
//
// A hardware mouse/trackpad is a pointer, not a finger. When the scene is pointer-LOCKED
// (full-screen + frontmost iPad, and the user hasn't disabled pointer capture in Settings —
// see PointerLockChain, which steers the lock request through SwiftUI's hosting controllers)
// GCMouse delivers raw relative deltas and the system hides the cursor — the gaming-grade path.
// InputCapture handles EVERY connected mouse (GCMouse.mice), not just the current one, so a
// trackpad + a second pointer (e.g. a Universal Control mouse) both drive. When the scene CAN'T
// lock (Stage Manager, not frontmost, iPhone, capture disabled) the system shows its own cursor
// and routes the mouse through UIKit's pointer path: hover + indirect-pointer touches, which we
// forward as ABSOLUTE cursor position (+ buttons) so the host cursor tracks the visible local one.
// We never forward an indirect pointer as a touch — doing so hid the cursor and made the host see
// taps instead of a moving mouse. The two paths are mutually exclusive on `gcMouseForwarding`
// (== locked): GCMouse forwards only WHILE locked, the UIKit indirect path (motion, buttons AND
// scroll) only while NOT locked — so a pointer that emits both channels under lock can't double-send.
// Hardware keyboard forwarding shares InputCapture with macOS — auto-engaged when streaming
// starts, ⌘⎋ toggles and ⌃⌥⇧Q releases (both detected from the HID stream; there is no NSEvent
// monitor here). ⌃⌥⇧Q is the cross-client Ctrl+Alt+Shift+Q — it un-captures so the Magic Keyboard
// trackpad drives the local iPad UI again.
//
// The public type is named StreamView like its macOS twin (each is platform-gated), so
// the SwiftUI app layer is identical on both platforms.
