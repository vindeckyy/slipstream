// SwiftUI presentation: AVSampleBufferDisplayLayer fed straight from the slipstream/1 connection.
//
// Stage-1 presenter (see README): the layer accepts *compressed* HEVC sample buffers and
// does hardware decode + display itself — fastest path to pixels, IOSurface-backed
// zero-copy on Apple silicon. Stage 2 (explicit VTDecompressionSession + CAMetalLayer)
// replaces this when we start tuning frame pacing / measuring glass-to-glass.
//
// The view also owns the input-capture state machine (Moonlight-style): capture is a
// deliberate, reversible state — engaged when the stream starts and when the user clicks
// into the video, released by ⌃⌥⇧Q (the cross-client Ctrl+Alt+Shift+Q), ⌘⎋, or focus
// loss, and NEVER engaged by mere app activation (the click that activates the window may
// be a title-bar drag or a resize — warping the cursor there is exactly the intrusiveness
// this design removes). While released, nothing is forwarded to the host and the local
// cursor is free.
//
// macOS-first (NSViewRepresentable); the iOS variant is the same layer under
// UIViewRepresentable.
