// The app's "Stream" menu (macOS menu bar + iPad hardware-keyboard shortcuts). These live at
// the Scene level so they keep working when the HUD overlay is hidden. The shortcuts are the
// CROSS-CLIENT set every slipstream client reserves — Ctrl+Alt+Shift+Q (release the captured
// mouse) / +D (disconnect) / +S (stats), plus +A (mute the microphone), the Apple clients'
// addition to it — and the menu is their discoverable surface on macOS
// (the Linux client has its GTK Shortcuts window and the start-of-stream banner). While
// input is CAPTURED these key equivalents never reach the menu (the stream view swallows
// keys); InputCapture's monitor detects the same combos there and performs the same actions —
// the menu covers the released state and discoverability. The stats item cycles the shared
// `statsVerbosity` tier (off → compact → normal → detailed → off); ContentView reads the same
// @AppStorage and reacts.
//
// tvOS has no menu bar / hardware-keyboard command surface (disconnect there is the Siri
// Remote's Menu button, handled by ContentView's `.onExitCommand`), so this whole file is
// non-tvOS only.
