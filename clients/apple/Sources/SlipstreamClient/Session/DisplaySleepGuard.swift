// Keeps the local display awake for the duration of a streaming session.
//
// A stream is not "user activity" to the OS: the pixels arrive over the network and the input that
// drives them is often a game controller, which does NOT feed the HID idle timer on any Apple
// platform. So a controller-only session reliably idles the panel out from under the user — the
// same reason the Android client holds FLAG_KEEP_SCREEN_ON while streaming (StreamScreen.kt).
//
// Held by SessionModel from `beginStreaming` to `disconnect`, so it is scoped to the session and
// never leaks past it (including a host-ended or timed-out background session, which both land in
// `disconnect`).
