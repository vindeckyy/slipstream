// The one piece of gamepad-menu machinery shared by the host launcher (GamepadHomeView) and the
// library coverflow (LibraryCoverflowView): a horizontal, center-snapping carousel driven entirely
// by a controller (iOS/iPadOS/macOS) — or, on tvOS, by the NATIVE FOCUS ENGINE: every card is a
// focusable Button, so the Siri Remote and a game controller both navigate through the system
// (dpad/swipe moves focus, select activates, Menu backs out at the presentation level), and the
// cursor/scroll chase the focused card instead of the poll. The poll still runs on tvOS but
// carries ONLY the Y/X actions (library/settings) — buttons the focus engine has no concept of.
// The iOS/macOS poll-driven behavior is untouched by the tvOS mode.
//
// The scrolling is pure native SwiftUI — `.scrollTargetLayout()` + `.scrollTargetBehavior(.viewAligned)`
// snap exactly one item to center, and symmetric `.safeAreaPadding(.horizontal)` (sized off the live
// container width, so it's correct in an iPad split view too) lets the first and last item reach the
// middle. The CALLER owns each card's look, including its own `.scrollTransition` — this component
// deliberately applies none, so a screen can chain the VisualEffect-only transition modifiers without
// the generic wrapper here pushing the type-checker onto an overload it can't satisfy.
//
// Navigation authority: an internal `cursor` (an index), NOT the scroll-position binding, is the
// source of truth for where the gamepad is. `.scrollPosition(id:)` is a two-way binding and the
// scroll view WRITES intermediate ids into it while a programmatic animation is in flight — so
// reading the "current" item back out of it to compute the next one desyncs badly on a fast held
// stick (each move reads a lagging value and the cursor stalls before the last item). Instead a move
// advances `cursor` synchronously and points the scroll view at `items[cursor]`; scroll read-back is
// only allowed to move the cursor when the gamepad hasn't driven recently (i.e. a touch drag).
//
// Feedback is dual-channel by design: `.sensoryFeedback` ticks the DEVICE Taptic engine (for a
// handheld/touch user) and `MenuHaptics` ticks the CONTROLLER (for a couch user holding the pad).
// Both fire on a move, on confirm, and — for a non-wrapping list — a duller bump plus a short visual
// recoil when a move is refused at either end.
