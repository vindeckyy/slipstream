// The gamepad-driven home screen: a distinct, "10-foot" console-style host
// launcher shown INSTEAD of HomeView while GamepadUIEnvironment is active — a separate screen built
// around a center-snapping carousel of hosts, driven from the couch with a controller. No touch is
// required anywhere: A connects, Y opens a saved host's library (when the flag is on), X opens the
// gamepad settings screen, and the carousel always ends in an Add Host tile that opens the
// controller-keyboard add flow. (A tap still works as a fallback for all of it.)
//
// All the scrolling/snapping/navigation/haptics live in GamepadCarousel; this file is the launcher's
// chrome. Layout discipline (so nothing is EVER clipped, portrait or landscape): the gradient is a
// `.background` modifier — NOT a ZStack sibling — because an `.ignoresSafeArea()` sibling expands the
// stack to full-screen and hands the GeometryReader the full height, laying content out under the
// status bar / home indicator. As a background it draws behind without affecting layout, so the
// GeometryReader is sized to the safe area. The title and the controller-glyph hints are pinned with
// `.safeAreaInset` (top / bottom-leading) — guaranteed inside the safe area and out of the carousel's
// vertical budget — and the card is sized off the remaining height. macOS mounts it too (the
// couch Mac-mini case) — same screen, with the settings/add-host covers presented as sheets
// (macOS has no fullScreenCover). tvOS mounts it as well, driven by the native focus engine
// (see GamepadCarousel's tvOS mode) so the Siri Remote works alongside the pad; Play/Pause
// mirrors X for Settings since the focus engine has no concept of that button.
