// "Copy Link" on a host or pinned card puts a `slipstream://` URL on the clipboard — the same
// self-emitted form a desktop shortcut would carry (design/client-deep-links.md §5):
// stable id first, with the address and pin alongside so it still resolves after the record is
// re-addressed or the store is wiped.
//
// The pasteboard is the one part of that with no cross-platform API, hence this two-line shim.
// tvOS has no clipboard at all, so the affordance simply isn't offered there.
