// This client's persistent slipstream/1 identity: a self-signed certificate + key (PEM),
// generated once and stored in the data-protection Keychain (with a legacy file-keychain
// fallback for unsigned builds — see `query(dataProtection:)`). The certificate's fingerprint is how
// hosts recognize this client after PIN pairing — losing the key un-pairs this Mac from
// every host, so the pair is presented on every connect but never regenerated once
// stored. That invariant drives the error handling below: a Keychain that *refuses
// access* (locked, ACL denied) is an error, not a first run — minting a replacement
// would silently shadow the durable identity and break every existing pairing.
