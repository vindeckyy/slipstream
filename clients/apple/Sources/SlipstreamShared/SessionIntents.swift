// App Intents that must compile into BOTH the app and the widget extension live here in the shared

// LiveActivityIntent runs in the APP's process) which M4 also surfaces to Siri/Shortcuts.
//
// Gated on os(iOS): LiveActivityIntent is part of ActivityKit's world (iPhone/iPad only). The M4
// Connect/Wake intents that need the app's router live in the app target, not here.
