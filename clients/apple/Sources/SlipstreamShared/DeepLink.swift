// The `slipstream://` URL grammar — the single builder/parser shared by the widget (which emits
// links via `widgetURL`/`Link`), the App Intents (which round-trip through it rather than opening
// a second connect path) and the app (`ContentView.onOpenURL`, which routes them into the existing
// connect path). Keeping every side on one type means the wire format can't drift.
//
//   slipstream://connect/<host-ref>[?fp=<64-hex>][&host=<addr[:port]>][&launch=<id>]
//                                 [&profile=<ref>][&name=<label>]
//
// The invariant the grammar exists to keep: **a URL may only ever do what a click on an existing
// card could do, minus trust decisions.** So it carries *references* to things that already exist
// on this device — a host record, a settings profile, a library id — and never values: no
// resolution, no bitrate, no codec. A web page must not be able to shape a session beyond picking
// among the user's own configurations. `pair` is deliberately not a route and never will be;
// pairing stays an interactive ceremony.
//
// `pf://` parses as an alias so a hand-typed or legacy link still works, but nothing ever *emits*
// or registers it (design/client-deep-links.md §2).
//
// This is a port of `crates/ss-client-core/src/deeplink.rs`, and the two are held together by
// `clients/shared/deeplink-vectors.json` — 44 cases including every refusal code, run verbatim by
// both test suites. Change one parser and the other's suite fails, which is the point: three
// parsers that drift are three different security postures.
