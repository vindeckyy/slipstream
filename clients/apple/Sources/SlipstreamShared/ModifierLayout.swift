// Location-based modifier mapping — which Windows VK each PHYSICAL modifier position forwards to
// the host. A Mac keyboard's bottom row is `⌃ Control / ⌥ Option / ⌘ Command / space`; a Windows
// keyboard's is `Ctrl / ⊞ Super / Alt / space`. So the key NEAREST the space bar is Command on a
// Mac but Alt on Windows, and the next one out is Option on a Mac but the Windows key. A user who
// grew up on Windows reaches for Alt where the Mac has Command; this setting lets them get that
// muscle memory back WITHOUT relabelling keycaps — it remaps by physical position, not by a blunt
// "swap these two VKs" that would also drag Control/Shift or lose the left/right distinction.
//
// The model: keep the physical detection (which side, which key) exactly as the OS reports it, and
// swap only the Alt-vs-Super ROLE between the Option and Command keys, per side. So under `.windows`
// the ⌘ position emits Alt (VK_L/RMENU) and the ⌥ position emits the Windows key (VK_L/RWIN), while
// left stays left and right stays right. Control and Shift are in the same place on both keyboards,
// so they never move. Lives in SlipstreamShared because both the Settings UI (SlipstreamClient) and
// the wire-boundary remap (`InputCapture.applyModifierLayout`, SlipstreamKit) resolve it.
