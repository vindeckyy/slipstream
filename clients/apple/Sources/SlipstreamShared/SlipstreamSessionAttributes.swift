// and updates the Activity) and the widget extension (which renders it). Hence it lives in the
// dependency-free shared module.

// Gated on `os(iOS)`, NOT `canImport(ActivityKit)`: ActivityKit *imports* on macOS but its types
// are `@available(macOS, unavailable)`, so canImport would wrongly admit this on the macOS build.
// Live Activities are iPhone/iPad only (iPadOS reports os(iOS)).
//
// Naming/shape is a runtime contract: an Activity started by one build is decoded by the extension
// of the same build, so keep `ContentState` Codable-stable across releases the way `StoredHost` is.
