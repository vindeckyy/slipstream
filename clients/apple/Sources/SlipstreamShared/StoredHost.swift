// The saved-host model + its on-disk JSON wire format — the widget/extension depends on BOTH, so
// they live in the dependency-free shared module. The `ObservableObject` store that wraps them
// (`HostStore`, with add/remove/pin/reachability) stays in the app target; discovery-join helpers
// (`matches`, `advertises`) stay there too because they reference SlipstreamKit's `DiscoveredHost`.
//
// Wire-format stability: the JSON encoding of `StoredHost` is now a shared contract between the app
// (writer) and the widget (reader). The `SlipstreamSharedTests` codec round-trip pins it — do not
// rename the coding keys or make a stored `Optional` non-optional (older saved JSON must still
// decode; synthesized Decodable treats a missing Optional as nil).
