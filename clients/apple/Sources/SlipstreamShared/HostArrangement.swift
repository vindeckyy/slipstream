// How the host grid is ordered and grouped.
//
// Pure value logic, deliberately: which card lands where is the kind of thing that reads as
// obviously right and behaves subtly wrong (an unstable sort reshuffling equal rows on every
// redraw, a never-connected host sorting as if it were connected in 1970), so it lives apart from
// the view and is tested. It sits in SlipstreamShared because everything it touches — `StoredHost`,
// `ProfileCatalog` — already does.
//
// It arranges CARDS, not hosts. A host contributes its own card plus one per pinned profile
// (§5.2a), and under profile grouping those go to different bands — the pinned card belongs to
// the profile it connects with, which is the whole reason it exists.
