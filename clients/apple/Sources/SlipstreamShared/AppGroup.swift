// The App-Group foundation shared by the app and its extensions (Widgets / Live Activity).

// SlipstreamShared is deliberately dependency-free: it links NEITHER SlipstreamKit (which drags in
// the Rust staticlib + presentation layer) NOR any Apple UI framework. A widget process gets ~30 MB,
// so everything an extension needs — the stored-host model + its JSON codec, the settings-key names,
// the deep-link grammar, and (later) the Live Activity attributes — lives here and here only.
