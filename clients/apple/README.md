# slipstream Apple client (SwiftUI)

The native macOS/iOS client for **`slipstream/1`** (the post-GameStream protocol). All
networking/protocol work — QUIC control plane, UDP data plane, GF(2¹⁶) FEC, AES-GCM,
input datagrams, Opus audio, cert pinning — lives in the shared Rust core (statically
linked as `SlipstreamCore.xcframework`); this package is the Swift shell: decode
(VideoToolbox), present (SwiftUI), input capture.

## Status — first light achieved (2026-06-10)

Validated live, Mac ↔ Linux box over the LAN: gamescope virtual output → NVENC HEVC →
`slipstream/1` (GF(2¹⁶) FEC + AES-GCM over UDP, QUIC control) → VideoToolbox →
`AVSampleBufferDisplayLayer` on glass at 1280×720@60, with mouse/keyboard flowing back as
QUIC datagrams into the host's gamescope EIS injector (thousands of events injected during
the session). Headless variant of the same proof: `RemoteFirstLightTests` decoded 60/60
received AUs spanning 983 ms of host capture clock.

The connector underneath (`slipstream_core::client::NativeClient` over the C ABI) carries the
full session: video AUs, **Opus audio** (`nextAudio()`), **rumble** (`nextRumble()`),
input incl. gamepads, and **cert pinning + TOFU** (`pinSHA256:`/`hostFingerprint`) — see
`m3.rs::tests::c_abi_connection_roundtrip` (three sequential sessions: TOFU, pinned
reconnect, wrong-pin rejection). The host (`slipstream-host m3-host`) is a persistent listener:
reconnect at will during development.

What's here, all compiled and tested on macOS (Xcode 26.5 / Swift 6.3):

- **`SlipstreamKit`** (library)
  - `SlipstreamConnection.swift` — wrapper over the C ABI. AUs/audio are copied into `Data`
    (the C pointer is only valid until the next call of the same kind). `close()` is safe
    from any thread: per-plane locks enforce the C contract ("never close with a
    `next_au`/`next_audio` in flight") instead of leaving it to callers. Pinning + TOFU
    via `pinSHA256:`/`hostFingerprint`.
  - `AnnexB.swift` — in-band VPS/SPS/PPS → `CMVideoFormatDescription`; Annex-B → AVCC
    `CMSampleBuffer` with `DisplayImmediately` set.
  - `StreamView.swift` — SwiftUI `NSViewRepresentable` over `AVSampleBufferDisplayLayer`
    (stage-1 presenter: the layer hardware-decodes compressed HEVC itself). One pump
    thread per view, token-cancelled so reconnects can't double-pump.
  - `InputCapture.swift` — `GCMouse` raw deltas + `GCKeyboard` HID→VK mapping (the host's
    `vk_to_evdev` consumes Windows VKs), with fractional-delta accumulation so sub-pixel
    motion isn't truncated away. Buttons use GameStream ids (1=left … 5=X2). Scroll
    arrives via the stream view's `scrollWheel` override instead of GC (trackpad/Magic
    Mouse gestures never reach GCMouse's scroll dpad), WHEEL_DELTA(120)-scaled.
- **`SlipstreamClient`** (the app): hosts grid (saved in UserDefaults), "+" toolbar
  sheet to add hosts, stream mode in Settings (⌘,), two trust flows — the
  trust-on-first-use fingerprint prompt over the live-but-blurred stream, and SPAKE2 PIN
  pairing (`PairSheet`, from a host card's context menu or the trust prompt;
  `ClientIdentityStore` keeps the client identity in the Keychain and presents it on
  every connect) — then pinned reconnects, fps/Mb-s HUD. Settings also picks the HOST
  compositor (KWin/wlroots/Mutter/gamescope, default automatic — the host honors it
  only if that backend is available there). (Audio playback and
  gamepad capture are not wired into the app yet — the connector surface is there; see
  notes 5–6.)
- **Tests** (`swift test`): byte-level Annex-B units; a real-codec round trip
  (VTCompressionSession-encoded HEVC rebuilt as the host's wire shape → `AnnexB` →
  VTDecompressionSession → pixels); loopback integration against real local hosts
  (`test-loopback.sh` — stream round trip, plus the PIN pairing ceremony and the
  `--require-pairing` gate against a second, armed host); the remote first-light test
  above.

## Xcode project (`Slipstream.xcodeproj`)

The app target **Slipstream** wraps the same sources as the `swift run` shell
(`Sources/SlipstreamClient`, a synchronized folder — no duplication) plus `App/` (asset
catalog) and links `SlipstreamKit` from the local package. Generated Info.plist, ad-hoc
signing, bundle id `io.unom.slipstream`. Notes:

- **App icon**: `App/Assets.xcassets` ships an empty `AppIcon` slot. For an Icon Composer
  `.icon`: add the file to the project (target Slipstream), set it as the App Icon in the
  target's General tab, and delete the placeholder `AppIcon.appiconset`. Heads-up: CLI
  `actool` (Xcode 26.5) crashed compiling `slipstream_Logo.icon` — if Xcode does the same,
  suspect the icon bundle (it has a duplicate-named layer, "…Layer-3 2.svg"), not the
  project.
- **Tests from Xcode**: the package tests run with `swift test`; to get them on ⌘U, add
  `SlipstreamKitTests` once via Edit Scheme → Test → + (Xcode persists it into the shared
  scheme — a hand-written package-test reference doesn't resolve headlessly).
- `xcodebuild -project Slipstream.xcodeproj -scheme Slipstream build` works headlessly.

## Notes for whoever picks this up next

1. **cbindgen import quirk** (the predicted "small compile fixes", now fixed): the
   C17-compatible header spells `SlipstreamStatus`/`SlipstreamInputKind` as integer typedefs while
   the enum *constants* import into Swift as a distinct same-named type — bridge with
   `.rawValue` (see the top of `SlipstreamConnection.swift`). Don't fight the generated header.
2. **ABI contract**: one video pump thread per connection, plus optionally one *separate*
   audio drain thread for `nextAudio()`/`nextRumble()` (the core keeps per-plane borrow
   slots, so the planes never alias); `send()` is enqueue-only and safe alongside all of
   them. The wrapper's per-plane locks make `close()` safe from anywhere (it waits out
   in-flight polls, ≤ their timeouts).
3. **Decode flow**: the host opens every stream with an IDR carrying VPS/SPS/PPS in-band
   and recovery keyframes re-send them — "refresh the format description on every IDR"
   (what `StreamView` does) is sufficient; there is no out-of-band extradata, ever.
4. **Stage 2 (next)**: explicit `VTDecompressionSession` + `CAMetalLayer` for frame-pacing
   control (ProMotion/120 Hz), glass-to-glass measurement via `tools/latency-probe` (the
   host stamps `pts_ns` with its capture wall clock; across machines you need a clock
   offset estimate from the QUIC RTT).
5. **Audio — wired, both directions.** Playback: `SessionAudio` drains `nextAudio()`
   on its own thread, decodes through CoreAudio's built-in Opus codec (`OpusCodec.swift`
   — kAudioFormatOpus, no bundled libopus; round-trip unit-tested) into a priming
   jitter ring feeding an `AVAudioSourceNode`. Mic: a second engine taps the input
   device, resamples to 48 kHz stereo, Opus-encodes 20 ms chunks and `sendMic()`s them
   (the host's virtual PipeWire source accepts any frame size ≤ 120 ms). Speaker/mic
   are chosen in Settings (`AudioDevices.swift` — persisted by UID; "System default"
   leaves the engines unpinned so they follow macOS device changes), mic on/off toggle
   included; the app asks for mic permission on first use
   (NSMicrophoneUsageDescription is in the Xcode target). A/V sync and packet-loss
   concealment beyond silence-fill are still open (AudioPacket.seq/ptsNs carry what's
   needed). Decode with libopus or `AVAudioConverter`/`kAudioFormatOpus` into an
   `AVAudioEngine` source node; conceal gaps (drop/dup) rather than blocking — the Rust
   side buffers 320 ms and drops the newest packet when the puller lags. Wall-clock
   `ptsNs` shares the host clock with video AUs for A/V sync. Wiring this into
   `SlipstreamClient` is the next app-side task.
6. **Gamepads**: `GCController` → `.gamepadButton(...)`/`.gamepadAxis(...)` events (wire
   contract documented on the constructors; the host accumulates them into a virtual
   Xbox 360 pad). Poll `nextRumble()` and feed `GCDeviceHaptics` for force feedback.
   Client-side capture isn't in `InputCapture` yet.
7. **Trust — the full ceremony exists now (SPAKE2).** `generateIdentity()` once (persist
   both PEMs in the Keychain), then `pair(host:identity:pin:name:)` with the 4-digit PIN
   the host prints when it ARMS pairing (`--allow-pairing`/`--require-pairing`; one PIN
   per arming window, shown at startup — the user reads it before pairing). Returns the
   host's VERIFIED fingerprint; persist it and pass `pinSHA256:` + `identity:` to every
   connect. Pairing is a real PAKE: a wrong PIN gets ONE online guess (no offline
   dictionary attack), throwing `.wrongPIN`; a wrong-size pin throws `.invalidPin`. `SlipstreamClient` implements both flows:
   the TOFU fingerprint sheet keeps working against hosts not running
   `--require-pairing`, and the PIN ceremony is wired in — `ClientIdentityStore`
   (Keychain) on every connect, `PairSheet` from a host card's context menu or the trust
   prompt's "Pair with PIN instead…" (the host's accept loop is sequential, so that path
   drops the live session before pairing). With `--require-pairing` the host now
   authorizes clients too (the "other direction" is no longer open, opt-in per host);
   the whole gate is regression-tested in `testPairingCeremonyAndRequirePairingGate`.
7b. **Resize without reconnect**: `requestMode(width:height:refreshHz:)` mid-stream —
   the host rebuilds at the new mode in ~90 ms; the first new-mode AU is an IDR with
   fresh parameter sets (the refresh-on-IDR decode flow handles it untouched) and
   `currentMode()` reflects the switch. Wire it to window-resize events.
8. **Input capture** (stage 1): capture is a deliberate, reversible STATE owned by
   `StreamLayerView`, Moonlight-style. Engaged when the stream starts / trust is
   confirmed and when the user clicks into the video (that click is suppressed toward
   the host); released by ⌘⎋ (toggles) or focus loss; NEVER engaged by mere app
   activation — activating clicks may be title-bar drags or resizes, which used to get
   their cursor warped away mid-drag. While captured: the local cursor is hidden +
   frozen mid-view (the host renders its own), all input is forwarded, and the view
   consumes key events as first responder so unhandled keyDowns don't beep — ⌘-combos
   still work locally (⌘D disconnect, ⌘Q) *and* reach the host via GC. While released:
   nothing is forwarded (`InputCapture.forwarding` gates the GC handlers; held
   keys/buttons are flushed host-side on release so nothing sticks down), the cursor is
   free, and the HUD shows "Click the stream to capture input". GC handlers only fire
   while the app has focus, and focus loss also auto-releases everything held. One live capture per process (the GC
   mouse/keyboard singletons have a single handler slot — ownership is tracked so a stale
   capture's stop() can't clobber a newer one).
9. **iOS**: same package (`BUILD_IOS=1` for the xcframework slice); `StreamView` needs the
   `UIViewRepresentable` twin and touch→input mapping.

## Known limitations of the current host (relevant to client UX)

- One session **at a time** (the listener is persistent, but a second concurrent client
  waits in the accept queue until the current session ends — the virtual output and
  encoder are single-tenant).
- Mid-stream renegotiation (resolution change without reconnect) is designed-for but not
  implemented (the Welcome is one-shot today).
- Host-side gamepad injection needs `/dev/uinput` access on the box (udev rule from
  `docs/linux-setup.md`).
