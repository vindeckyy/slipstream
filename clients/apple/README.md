# lumen Apple client (SwiftUI)

The native macOS/iOS client for **`lumen/1`** (the post-GameStream protocol). All
networking/protocol work — QUIC control plane, UDP data plane, GF(2¹⁶) FEC, AES-GCM,
input datagrams, Opus audio, cert pinning — lives in the shared Rust core (statically
linked as `LumenCore.xcframework`); this package is the Swift shell: decode
(VideoToolbox), present (SwiftUI), input capture.

## Status — first light achieved (2026-06-10)

Validated live, Mac ↔ Linux box over the LAN: gamescope virtual output → NVENC HEVC →
`lumen/1` (GF(2¹⁶) FEC + AES-GCM over UDP, QUIC control) → VideoToolbox →
`AVSampleBufferDisplayLayer` on glass at 1280×720@60, with mouse/keyboard flowing back as
QUIC datagrams into the host's gamescope EIS injector (thousands of events injected during
the session). Headless variant of the same proof: `RemoteFirstLightTests` decoded 60/60
received AUs spanning 983 ms of host capture clock.

The connector underneath (`lumen_core::client::NativeClient` over the C ABI) carries the
full session: video AUs, **Opus audio** (`nextAudio()`), **rumble** (`nextRumble()`),
input incl. gamepads, and **cert pinning + TOFU** (`pinSHA256:`/`hostFingerprint`) — see
`m3.rs::tests::c_abi_connection_roundtrip` (three sequential sessions: TOFU, pinned
reconnect, wrong-pin rejection). The host (`lumen-host m3-host`) is a persistent listener:
reconnect at will during development.

What's here, all compiled and tested on macOS (Xcode 26.5 / Swift 6.3):

- **`LumenKit`** (library)
  - `LumenConnection.swift` — wrapper over the C ABI. AUs/audio are copied into `Data`
    (the C pointer is only valid until the next call of the same kind). `close()` is safe
    from any thread: per-plane locks enforce the C contract ("never close with a
    `next_au`/`next_audio` in flight") instead of leaving it to callers. Pinning + TOFU
    via `pinSHA256:`/`hostFingerprint`.
  - `AnnexB.swift` — in-band VPS/SPS/PPS → `CMVideoFormatDescription`; Annex-B → AVCC
    `CMSampleBuffer` with `DisplayImmediately` set.
  - `StreamView.swift` — SwiftUI `NSViewRepresentable` over `AVSampleBufferDisplayLayer`
    (stage-1 presenter: the layer hardware-decodes compressed HEVC itself). One pump
    thread per view, token-cancelled so reconnects can't double-pump.
  - `InputCapture.swift` — `GCMouse` raw deltas + `GCKeyboard` HID→VK mapping (the host's
    `vk_to_evdev` consumes Windows VKs), with fractional-delta accumulation so sub-pixel
    motion isn't truncated away. Buttons use GameStream ids (1=left … 5=X2); scroll is
    WHEEL_DELTA(120)-scaled.
- **`LumenClient`** (development app shell): connect form → stream + input, fps/Mb-s HUD.
  (Audio playback and gamepad capture are not wired into the app yet — the connector
  surface is there; see notes 5–6.)
- **Tests** (`swift test`): byte-level Annex-B units; a real-codec round trip
  (VTCompressionSession-encoded HEVC rebuilt as the host's wire shape → `AnnexB` →
  VTDecompressionSession → pixels); loopback integration against a real local host
  (`test-loopback.sh`); the remote first-light test above.

## Build / run / test (on a Mac)

```sh
rustup target add aarch64-apple-darwin x86_64-apple-darwin
bash scripts/build-xcframework.sh        # → clients/apple/LumenCore.xcframework
cd clients/apple
swift build && swift test                # loopback/remote tests self-skip without a host
swift run LumenClient                    # the app; or open Package.swift in Xcode

bash test-loopback.sh                    # full loopback proof: builds lumen-host
                                         # (synthetic source — runs on macOS), streams
                                         # byte-verified frames into the Swift client

# against the real host (Linux box, see CLAUDE.md "Running on this box") — m3-host is a
# persistent listener, reconnect at will:
#   LUMEN_COMPOSITOR=gamescope LUMEN_GAMESCOPE_APP=vkcube LUMEN_ZEROCOPY=1 \
#   cargo run -rp lumen-host -- m3-host --source virtual --seconds 60
LUMEN_REMOTE_HOST=<box-ip> swift test --filter RemoteFirstLightTests   # headless
LUMEN_AUTOCONNECT=<box-ip> LUMEN_MODE=1280x720x60 swift run LumenClient # on glass
```

## Notes for whoever picks this up next

1. **cbindgen import quirk** (the predicted "small compile fixes", now fixed): the
   C17-compatible header spells `LumenStatus`/`LumenInputKind` as integer typedefs while
   the enum *constants* import into Swift as a distinct same-named type — bridge with
   `.rawValue` (see the top of `LumenConnection.swift`). Don't fight the generated header.
2. **ABI contract**: one video pump thread per connection, plus optionally one *separate*
   audio drain thread for `nextAudio()`/`nextRumble()` (the core keeps per-plane borrow
   slots, so the planes never alias); `send()` is enqueue-only and safe alongside all of
   them. The wrapper's per-plane locks make `close()` safe from anywhere (it waits out
   in-flight polls, ≤ their timeouts).
3. **Decode flow**: the host opens every stream with an IDR carrying VPS/SPS/PPS in-band
   and recovery keyframes re-send them — "refresh the format description on every IDR"
   (what `StreamView` does) is sufficient; there is no out-of-band extradata, ever.
4. **Stage 2 (next)**: explicit `VTDecompressionSession` + `CAMetalLayer` for frame-pacing
   control (ProMotion/120 Hz), glass-to-glass measurement via `tools/latency-probe` (the
   host stamps `pts_ns` with its capture wall clock; across machines you need a clock
   offset estimate from the QUIC RTT).
5. **Audio**: `nextAudio()` yields raw Opus packets (48 kHz stereo, one 5 ms frame each,
   sequence-numbered). Decode with libopus or `AVAudioConverter`/`kAudioFormatOpus` into an
   `AVAudioEngine` source node; conceal gaps (drop/dup) rather than blocking — the Rust
   side buffers 320 ms and drops the newest packet when the puller lags. Wall-clock
   `ptsNs` shares the host clock with video AUs for A/V sync. Wiring this into
   `LumenClient` is the next app-side task.
6. **Gamepads**: `GCController` → `.gamepadButton(...)`/`.gamepadAxis(...)` events (wire
   contract documented on the constructors; the host accumulates them into a virtual
   Xbox 360 pad). Poll `nextRumble()` and feed `GCDeviceHaptics` for force feedback.
   Client-side capture isn't in `InputCapture` yet.
7. **Trust**: connect once with `pinSHA256: nil` (TOFU), persist `hostFingerprint` keyed
   by host, pass it on every later connect — a mismatch throws `.connectFailed`. The host
   logs its fingerprint at startup ("clients pin this fingerprint") for out-of-band
   verification UX; a PIN-style pairing ceremony is a later lumen-core task. `LumenClient`
   doesn't persist fingerprints yet — add it alongside the "add host" UX.
8. **Input capture caveats** (stage 1): GC handlers only fire while the app has focus —
   on focus loss `InputCapture` auto-releases everything still held (keys + buttons) so
   nothing sticks down host-side. Local shortcuts (⌘-anything) still also reach the host;
   a capture toggle is a small follow-up. One live capture per process (the GC mouse/
   keyboard singletons have a single handler slot — ownership is tracked so a stale
   capture's stop() can't clobber a newer one).
9. **iOS**: same package (`BUILD_IOS=1` for the xcframework slice); `StreamView` needs the
   `UIViewRepresentable` twin and touch→input mapping.

## Known limitations of the current host (relevant to client UX)

- One session **at a time** (the listener is persistent, but a second concurrent client
  waits in the accept queue until the current session ends — the virtual output and
  encoder are single-tenant).
- Mid-stream renegotiation (resolution change without reconnect) is designed-for but not
  implemented (the Welcome is one-shot today).
- Host-side gamepad injection needs `/dev/uinput` access on the box (udev rule from
  `docs/linux-setup.md`).
