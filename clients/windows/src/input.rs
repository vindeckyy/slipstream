//! Stream input: Win32 low-level keyboard + mouse hooks forwarding to the host while the WinUI
//! window is focused and the pointer is captured.
//!
//! windows-reactor exposes no raw key-down/up or pointer-position/wheel events (only keyboard
//! *accelerators* and pointer button-state), which is insufficient for a game stream. So this
//! drops below XAML to `WH_KEYBOARD_LL` / `WH_MOUSE_LL`, installed on the UI thread when the
//! stream page mounts and removed when it unmounts.
//!
//! **Pointer lock.** While captured the cursor is *locked* the way a game-streaming client locks
//! it (Moonlight/Parsec): the OS cursor is hidden + confined to the window (`ClipCursor`), and
//! every physical move is turned into a **relative** delta (`InputKind::MouseMove`) — we read the
//! offset from the window centre, ship it (scaled screen→host through the Contain-fit factor, with
//! sub-pixel remainder carried so slow drags aren't lost), then warp the cursor back to centre so
//! it never reaches a screen edge. This is why the old absolute path froze: swallowing
//! `WM_MOUSEMOVE` pinned the OS cursor, so `pt` never travelled and the absolute coordinate
//! snapped to one point. Keys carry the **US-positional VK** for the pressed physical key (the
//! slipstream wire contract shared by every first-party client — see [`scan_to_positional_vk`]):
//! the hook's layout-resolved `vkCode` must NOT go on the wire, or a non-US pair re-maps
//! positions through two layouts (German: y↔z swapped, ü lands on ö).
//!
//! **Capture state machine** (parity with the GTK/Swift clients): capture engages at stream
//! start, **Ctrl+Alt+Shift+Q** releases it (handing the cursor back to the local desktop), and a
//! **click on the stream** re-engages it. Losing foreground also releases the lock so the cursor
//! is never stranded; regaining it while still captured re-locks. When "capture system
//! shortcuts" is off in Settings, Alt+Tab / Alt+Esc / Ctrl+Esc / the Win keys act on the local
//! desktop instead of being forwarded. **Ctrl+Alt+Shift+D disconnects** the session (consumed
//! locally, works captured or released while our window is foreground): it trips the session's
//! stop flag, the pump winds down, and the event loop navigates back to the host list.
//! **Ctrl+Alt+Shift+S** toggles the stats overlay live and **F11** toggles fullscreen — both are
//! client-local shortcuts (consumed, never forwarded), matching the GTK client's stream key set.
