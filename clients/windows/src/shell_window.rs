//! Hide/restore the shell's top-level window around a spawned session, so exactly ONE
//! Slipstream window is visible at a time: the spawned stream/browse window IS the app
//! while it runs (hidden = no taskbar entry, no Alt-Tab ghost), and the shell reappears
//! the moment the child exits — every exit path funnels through the spawn reader's
//! `Exited` event (clean end, error, crash, Disconnect kill), so the shell can never stay
//! hidden with no child.
//!
//! windows-reactor exposes no window handle, so the HWND is resolved by its (unique)
//! title and cached — the same pattern as `app::apply_window_icon_when_ready` and
//! `stream::window_dpi`.
