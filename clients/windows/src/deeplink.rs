//! `slipstream://` activation for the Windows shell (design/client-deep-links.md §4.2).
//!
//! Protocol activation of a full-trust packaged app delivers the URI as the command line, so
//! a browser prompt, `start slipstream://…` and a written `.lnk` all arrive the same way: as a
//! positional argument. What Windows does NOT give us is single-instancing — unlike
//! GApplication on Linux, a second activation is simply a second process. So this module adds
//! it: the first instance claims a named mutex, and any later one hands its URL to the winner
//! over `WM_COPYDATA` and exits.
//!
//! A URL must never be silently dropped, which is why the hand-off retries while the primary's
//! window is still coming up, and why a hand-off that ultimately fails falls back to running
//! this instance normally rather than exiting quietly.
