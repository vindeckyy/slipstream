//! The WinUI 3 (windows-reactor) application shell.
//!
//! Declarative React-like model: this root component routes on a `Screen` value held in
//! `use_async_state` so background threads (discovery, the session pump) can drive navigation.
//! Each screen lives in its own submodule:
//!
//! * [`hosts`] — saved/discovered/manual host list, plus per-host forget + speed test
//! * [`connect`] — the trust gate and session lifecycle glue (connect / request-access flows)
//! * [`pair`] — the SPAKE2 PIN pairing ceremony
//! * [`speed`] — the per-host network speed test (probe burst over the real data plane)
//! * [`settings`] — persisted preferences · [`licenses`] — the license notices screen ·
//!   [`help`] — the in-stream keyboard-shortcuts reference (reached from the host list)
//! * [`stream`] — the live stream: `SwapChainPanel` + D3D11 presenter + HUD overlay
//! * [`style`] — the shared look (cards, pills, monograms), following the windows-reactor
//!   gallery: Mica backdrop, a centred max-width column, theme brushes (`ThemeRef`)
//!
//! **Re-render discipline** (reactor's rules): each hook-using screen is mounted as its own
//! `component(...)` so its hooks live in an isolated slot list. A child's *sync* `use_state`
//! marks it dirty and re-renders it; an `AsyncSetState` written from a background thread does
//! NOT (the child is pruned when its props are unchanged) — so everything thread-driven
//! (discovery, HUD stats, speed-test results) is held as *root* state and passed down as props.
//! The present + decoded-frame handoff crosses to the UI thread through a `Mutex` side-channel
//! and thread-locals (the windows-reactor SwapChainPanel sample's pattern), since the per-frame
//! present must not go through state/rerender.
