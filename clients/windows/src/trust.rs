//! Client identity, the known-hosts (pinned fingerprint) store, and app settings —
//! re-exported from `pf-client-core` so the shell and the spawned `slipstream-session`
//! binary share ONE `Settings`/`KnownHosts` shape over the same files
//! (`%APPDATA%\slipstream\client-windows-settings.json` / `client-known-hosts.json`).
//!
//! The shell is the settings file's only writer; the session only reads it. The shell's
//! former private `Settings` copy (≤ 0.8.4: `show_hud`, `engine`) is gone — old files
//! still load via a serde alias in core, and the legacy in-process presenter is now
//! reachable only through `SLIPSTREAM_BUILTIN_STREAM=1` (see `app::use_builtin_stream`).
