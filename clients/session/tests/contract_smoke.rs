//! Runs the REAL `slipstream-session` binary and asserts it speaks the stdout contract.
//!
//! 0.22.0 shipped a stub as `slipstream-session` — a stray copy of the GTK shell replaced
//! this crate's `main.rs`, and every build gate stayed green because the wrong program
//! compiled perfectly. Nothing in CI ever *ran* the binary; the failure only existed at
//! runtime, as a connect that silently bounced back to the host list. This test is the
//! gate that would have caught it: whatever the binary does, it must SAY so on stdout.

/// desktop this may flash a window for under a second; the connect refuses immediately.)
