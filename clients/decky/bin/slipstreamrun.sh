# slipstream stream runner — the target of the hidden non-Steam shortcut the plugin creates.
#
# WHY A WRAPPER SCRIPT (load-bearing, from MoonDeck's hard-won knowledge): the stream client
# must be a descendant of the process Steam launches via `reaper`, or gamescope never gives
# its window focus/fullscreen in Gaming Mode (gamescope detects the "current app" by AppID,
# which only attaches to reaper's descendants — see gamescope#484). So the Decky plugin
# launches THIS script through SteamClient.Apps.RunGame; the script then execs the flatpak
# client, which inherits the shortcut's AppID and is focused. Launching the flatpak directly
# from the (root) Decky backend produces an unfocused, invisible window.
#
# Per-session parameters arrive as environment variables, set as the shortcut's Steam launch
# options by the plugin (SteamClient.Apps.SetAppLaunchOptions), so ONE generic shortcut serves
# every host (and every pinned game):
#   PF_HOST   host[:port] to connect to            (required for streaming; optional for browse)
#   PF_LAUNCH library id to launch on connect       (optional, e.g. steam:570 — pinned games)
#   PF_BROWSE non-empty = open the gamepad library  (optional; --browse instead of --connect)
#   PF_MGMT   management-API port for --browse       (optional; client defaults to 47990)
#   PF_CONNECT_TIMEOUT  connect budget in seconds    (optional; the plugin stretches it after
#                        firing Wake-on-LAN so the connect survives the host's resume)
#   PF_APPID  flatpak app id                        (default io.slipstream.Slipstream)
#   PF_FLATPAK  override the flatpak binary path     (default: `flatpak` on PATH)
#   PF_CLIENT_BIN  absolute path of a NATIVE client  (optional; set by the plugin when it
#                  resolved a non-flatpak install — then the client is exec'd directly and
#                  PF_APPID/PF_FLATPAK are unused)
#
# Values are plain tokens (the plugin validates launch ids to space/quote-free ASCII before
# they ever reach Steam launch options). An older flatpak without --launch/--browse ignores
# the unknown flags harmlessly (hand-scanned argv): PF_LAUNCH degrades to the plain desktop
# session, PF_BROWSE to the client's hosts page.
#
# Runs as the `deck` user (Steam launched it), so the --user flatpak install is visible and
# WAYLAND_DISPLAY / XDG_RUNTIME_DIR are already correct for gamescope.
#
# NO EXEC BIT REQUIRED: the Steam shortcut's exe is `/bin/sh` and this script rides behind
# `%command%` as an argument (see src/steam.ts). Decky extracts plugin zips without preserving
# permission bits and ~/homebrew/plugins is root-owned (the unprivileged plugin backend can't
# chmod), so the launch path must never depend on +x. Keep this script POSIX-sh clean.
