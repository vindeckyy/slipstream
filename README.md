Run the host on a Linux machine or a Windows PC, connect from a Mac, PC, phone, tablet, or TV, and
stream your desktop or games — each device at its **own native resolution and refresh rate**, over
your local network.

Slipstream pairs a **virtual-display streaming host** with native clients on every platform. It speaks
the existing **GameStream** protocol, so any [Moonlight](https://moonlight-stream.org/) client works
day one — and adds its own faster **`slipstream/1`** protocol that breaks the ~1 Gbps FEC wall with a
**GF(2¹⁶) Leopard-RS** transport. A single shared **Rust core** (`slipstream-core`) holds the
protocol, FEC, and crypto, linked into the host and every native client — directly as a Rust crate
on Linux and Windows, and over a stable C ABI from the Apple and Android apps.

## What makes it different

- **Your device's exact mode.** For each client that connects, the host spins up a virtual display
  sized to that device — 1080p60 to a laptop, 1440p120 to a desktop, 4K to a TV, all at once. No
  letterboxing, no scaling, no rearranging your real monitors.
- **Displays you configure, not just create.** Keep a game's display (and the game) alive across
  disconnects so a reconnect drops straight back in; make the stream your sole desktop or extend
  alongside your monitors; let several devices become monitors of one desktop; keep each client's
  scaling. One-click presets in the console — a dedicated couch box, a shared desktop, a multi-monitor
  workstation. See [Virtual displays](docs-site/content/docs/virtual-displays.md).
- **A real virtual display on Windows, too.** On Linux the host uses per-compositor virtual outputs;
  on Windows you get the same on-the-fly virtual display — at the client's exact mode, no physical
  monitor or dummy HDMI plug, even on the secure desktop (UAC / lock screen). It also has **its own
  indirect display driver (IDD)** the host pushes finished frames straight into, rather than scraping
  a screen — tight, push-based integration that's unusual for a Windows streaming host.
- **Low latency, GPU end to end.** Frames go straight from the compositor to the NVENC encoder with
  zero CPU copies (dmabuf → CUDA/Vulkan → NVENC), over a transport tuned for responsiveness rather
  than throughput. Stable 240 fps at 5120×1440; sub-millisecond capture-to-reassembly on-box,
  ~1.3 ms cross-machine on a LAN. (On Linux AMD/Intel, Vulkan Video for HEVC and AV1 with VAAPI for
  H.264 and as the fallback; a GPU-less software H.264 encoder exists as a last resort.)
- **A library that fills itself.** Steam and non-Steam titles show up as a grid on every client, and
  plugins add their own sources — ROM Manager (your ROM collection, matched to installed emulators),
  Playnite, VirtualHere. Install them from the console's **Plugins** page or with
  `slipstream-host plugins add`. See
  [Plugins](https://docs.slipstream.unom.io/docs/plugins).
- **Works with what you already have.** Any Moonlight/Artemis client connects over GameStream — and
  native apps for macOS, Linux, Windows, and Android use the lower-latency `slipstream/1` protocol.
- **Secure by default.** Hosts require a one-time SPAKE2 **PIN pairing**; after that, devices
  reconnect on a pinned identity. No accounts, no cloud. Hosts auto-advertise over mDNS, so clients
  find them on the network without typing an IP.

## Status

| Component | State |
|-----------|-------|
| **Core** — `slipstream-core` + C ABI (protocol · FEC · crypto · QUIC) | ✅ Complete & hardened |
| **GameStream host** → stock Moonlight | ✅ Live end-to-end: pairing, RTSP, audio, per-client virtual output at native resolution, GPU zero-copy NVENC, gamepads |
| **Native protocol** — `slipstream/1` | ✅ Validated live: QUIC control + GF(2¹⁶) FEC/AES-GCM data plane, PIN pairing, mDNS discovery, mid-stream mode renegotiation |
| **Windows host** (Windows 11 22H2+, x64) | ✅ Beta — shipping as a signed installer: its own all-Rust IddCx **virtual display** (secure-desktop capable) with a **sealed IDD-push** capture path — finished frames pushed straight into its own driver, not screen-scraped (no DDA/WGC) · GPU encode (NVENC on NVIDIA, AMF/QSV on AMD/Intel, software H.264 without a GPU) · WASAPI audio · bundled virtual-gamepad drivers (no ViGEmBus) · HDR incl. Vulkan-game HDR. NVIDIA live-validated; AMD/Intel CI-green |
| **macOS / iOS / tvOS client** (`clients/apple`) | ✅ Streaming live: VideoToolbox decode (HEVC, and AV1 on hardware that decodes it), controllers incl. DualSense, discovery, pairing, speed test |
| **Linux client** (`clients/linux` + `clients/session`) | ✅ Streaming live: relm4/GTK4 launcher shell that spawns a Vulkan session binary — Vulkan Video / VAAPI / software decode, PipeWire audio, SDL3 controllers, Skia console UI; ships as Flatpak/apt/rpm/Arch |
| **Android client** (`clients/android`, phone + TV) | ✅ Streaming live: AMediaCodec decode + HDR10, AAudio audio, controllers, discovery, pairing |
| **Windows client** (`clients/windows`, WinUI 3) | ✅ Streaming live: WinUI 3 shell + Vulkan session presenter, hardware decode on all GPU vendors via Vulkan Video → D3D11VA → software (NVIDIA + Intel validated on glass), WASAPI audio, SDL3 controllers, discovery, pairing; ships as signed MSIX (x64 + ARM64). Hardware decode and HDR10 present validated on glass on NVIDIA and Intel, including HDR pass-through on the Intel D3D11VA path |
| **Web console + management API** (`web/`) | ✅ TanStack console over the OpenAPI mgmt API: host status, paired devices, on-demand PIN pairing, game library, virtual-display presets, plugin store, GPU selection, performance capture graphs, live host logs, host updates |

Every native client also ships a tiered **stats overlay** (Compact / Normal / Detailed) with a
shared vocabulary across platforms, and the session client carries a full gamepad-driven **console
shell** (`pf-console-ui`): host list, PIN pairing, settings, and an on-screen keyboard.

The **GameStream host works with a stock Moonlight client** — validated live on NVIDIA hardware
(RTX 5070 Ti, RTX 4090): PIN pairing that persists across restarts, an app catalog, RTSP/ENet/audio,
and **video at the client's exact resolution and refresh** via a per-session virtual output (KWin,
gamescope, Mutter, and Sway/wlroots backends), encoded with GPU **zero-copy** (dmabuf → CUDA/Vulkan →
NVENC) up to 5120×1440@240. The native **`slipstream/1`** protocol adds a QUIC control plane and a
GF(2¹⁶) Leopard-FEC + AES-GCM data plane (p50 ~0.8 ms capture→received at 720p120), with
mid-stream mode renegotiation and a wall-clock skew handshake so latency stays valid across machines.
Both run from **one process**: bare `slipstream-host serve` is the **secure native-only default**
(`slipstream/1` + the management API/web console), and `serve --gamestream` additionally enables the
GameStream/Moonlight-compat planes (opt-in, trusted-LAN only — GameStream has inherent on-path
weaknesses). The host is managed through a REST API and web console. Builds against FFmpeg 7 or 8.

## Install the host

Pick your platform and install from its package registry — the per-platform guide covers adding the
repo, first run, and the web console. The Linux host is the primary, most battle-tested path; on
SteamOS the host is built on-device by a script instead, and a Windows host ships as a signed
installer (all-vendor: NVIDIA, AMD, Intel).

| Platform | Install | Guide |
|--------|---------|-------|
| **Ubuntu / Debian** (apt) | `sudo apt install slipstream-host` *(after adding the repo)* | [Ubuntu / Debian](https://docs.slipstream.unom.io/docs/ubuntu) · [packaging/debian](packaging/debian/README.md) |
| **Bazzite / Fedora Atomic** (systemd-sysext) | `curl -fsSLO https://github.com/vindeckyy/slipstream.git/raw/branch/main/packaging/bazzite/slipstream-sysext.sh && sudo bash slipstream-sysext.sh install` *(no layering, no reboot; rpm-ostree + bootc also supported)* | [Bazzite](https://docs.slipstream.unom.io/docs/bazzite) |
| **Fedora** (dnf) | `sudo dnf install slipstream` *(after adding the repo; the console comes with it)* | [Fedora](https://docs.slipstream.unom.io/docs/fedora) · [packaging/rpm](packaging/rpm/README.md) |
| **Arch / CachyOS** (pacman) | `sudo pacman -Syu slipstream-host` *(binary repo — always a full `-Syu`)* | [Arch Linux](https://docs.slipstream.unom.io/docs/arch) · [packaging/arch](packaging/arch/README.md) |
| **SteamOS / Steam Deck** (on-device build) | `bash ~/slipstream/scripts/steamdeck/install.sh` *(after cloning this repo to `~/slipstream`)* | [SteamOS (Host)](https://docs.slipstream.unom.io/docs/steamos-host) |
| **Windows** (11 22H2+, x64) | `winget install unom.SlipstreamHost` *(after `winget source add -n slipstream https://winget.slipstream.unom.io -t Microsoft.Rest`)* · or the signed `setup.exe` from the package registry | [Windows Host](https://docs.slipstream.unom.io/docs/windows-host) · [packaging/winget](packaging/winget/README.md) |

`slipstream-host` is the streaming host; `slipstream-web` is the browser console (pairing + status).

**Linux:** every package ships systemd **user** units, so you don't launch the host by hand. The
host unit won't start until `~/.config/slipstream/host.env` exists, so copy the template your package
installed first:

```sh
mkdir -p ~/.config/slipstream
# /usr/share/slipstream/ on Fedora/Arch/Bazzite, /usr/share/slipstream-host/ on Debian/Ubuntu
# (on Bazzite take host.env.bazzite instead)
cp /usr/share/slipstream/host.env.example ~/.config/slipstream/host.env

systemctl --user enable --now slipstream-host   # the streaming host
systemctl --user enable --now slipstream-web    # the web console (Arch: install slipstream-web first)
```

The shipped host unit runs `serve --gamestream` — the native `slipstream/1` plane **plus** the
GameStream/Moonlight-compat planes, which belong on a trusted LAN only; for a native-only host drop
the flag with a `systemctl --user edit slipstream-host` drop-in (which needs an empty `ExecStart=`
line before the replacement — the install guide has the snippet). Then open
`https://<host-ip>:47992` and pair.

How the virtual display and input are wired up depends on your desktop — see
[KDE](https://docs.slipstream.unom.io/docs/kde) · [GNOME](https://docs.slipstream.unom.io/docs/gnome) ·
[Steam / gamescope](https://docs.slipstream.unom.io/docs/gamescope) ·
[Sway](https://docs.slipstream.unom.io/docs/sway).

**Windows:** the installer registers and starts the host as a `LocalSystem` service, so there is
nothing to run by hand — open the web console and pair. Use
`slipstream-host service start|stop|restart|status` if you need to control it. Upgrades happen in
place — the console's **Updates** card, `winget upgrade unom.SlipstreamHost`, or the newer
`setup.exe` over the old install; uninstall from Add/Remove Programs.

Full instructions: **[docs.slipstream.unom.io/docs/install](https://docs.slipstream.unom.io/docs/install)**.

The console's **Host** page also shows when a newer host is out, along with the exact command for
how *this* box was installed (or a one-click **Update now** on Windows) — see
[Updating the host](https://docs.slipstream.unom.io/docs/updating). To remove it again, or to go back
to an earlier version, see [Uninstalling](https://docs.slipstream.unom.io/docs/uninstall) and
[Release Channels](https://docs.slipstream.unom.io/docs/channels#pin-a-version-or-roll-back).

## Connect a client

| Streaming to… | Use |
|---|---|
| Mac, iPhone, iPad, Apple TV | The **Apple app** (`clients/apple`) — also on TestFlight |
| Linux desktop / laptop | **`slipstream-client`** (Flatpak / apt / rpm / Arch) |
| Steam Deck | The **Decky plugin** in Gaming Mode — it launches the client for you ([Steam Deck](https://docs.slipstream.unom.io/docs/steam-deck)); in Desktop Mode, the Flatpak directly |
| Android phone or TV | The **Android app** (`clients/android`) |
| Windows | Native **`slipstream-client`** (signed MSIX) or **Moonlight** |
| Scripts, automation, another launcher | **`slipstream`** — the headless CLI shipped in the Linux client packages (`slipstream pair`, `slipstream hosts list --json`, `slipstream launch <host>`) |
| Anything else (browser, old phone, smart TV) | **Moonlight** over GameStream |

Each client discovers hosts on the network automatically and does a one-time
[PIN pairing](https://docs.slipstream.unom.io/docs/pairing). Per-device install steps:
**[/docs/install-client](https://docs.slipstream.unom.io/docs/install-client)**.

## Build & test (from source)

For development, or as an install fallback where no package is available:

```sh
cargo build --workspace          # core, host, tray, shared client crates, Linux shell + session client, the `slipstream` CLI, probe (Linux & macOS)
cargo test  --workspace          # unit + loopback + proptest + C ABI harness
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo fmt --all --check

cargo run -p loss-harness        # FEC loss-resilience sweep (no network needed)
bash crates/slipstream-core/tests/c/run.sh   # standalone C-ABI link + round-trip proof
```

The C header regenerates from `crates/slipstream-core/src/abi.rs` on every build (cbindgen via
`build.rs`) into `include/slipstream_core.h`. The Apple, Android, and Windows clients have their own
toolchains (Xcode/`swift build`, Gradle, and `cargo` on the MSVC target) — see each client's README
and the [docs site](https://docs.slipstream.unom.io).

## Design invariants

- **One core, linked everywhere.** Protocol, FEC, and crypto live in `slipstream-core` exactly once,
  exposed over a stable, versioned C ABI (`slipstream_abi_version()`, `SlipstreamConfig` carries its own
  `struct_size`). Every native client links the same core.
- **No async on the hot path.** The per-frame pipeline uses native threads only; `tokio`/`quinn` are
  gated behind the off-by-default `quic` feature (control plane only).
- **Native client resolution, no scaling.** Each session gets a virtual output at exactly the
  client's WxH@Hz; each compositor keeps its own backend behind a shared `VirtualDisplay` trait.
- **FEC is the wall-breaker.** GF(2⁸) (≤255 shards/block) for Moonlight compatibility; GF(2¹⁶)
  (≤65535 shards/block, SIMD, O(n log n)) for `slipstream/1` to push past ~1 Gbps.
