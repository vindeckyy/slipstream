description: The host.env settings — compositor, resolution, bitrate, input — and how to tune them.
---

The host reads its settings from **`~/.config/slipstream/host.env`** (a simple `KEY=value` file). Your
[setup guide](/docs/requirements) gives you a starting `host.env` for your desktop; this page is the
reference.

## Session settings

These tell the host which desktop session to attach to. Your setup guide sets them for you.

| Setting | What it does |
|---|---|
| `WAYLAND_DISPLAY` | The Wayland socket of your session (`wayland-0` for a normal desktop). |
| `XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP` | Your desktop (`GNOME`, `KDE`). |
| `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`, `DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS` | Needed when the host runs outside your interactive session (e.g. as a service). |

## Core settings

| Setting | Values | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `SLIPSTREAM_COMPOSITOR` | `mutter` · `kwin` · `gamescope` · `wlroots` | Which backend creates the virtual display. Match your desktop. |
| `SLIPSTREAM_VIDEO_SOURCE` | `virtual` · `portal` | `virtual` creates a per-client display at its exact mode (the normal choice). `portal` captures an existing monitor instead. |
| `SLIPSTREAM_ZEROCOPY` | `1` · `0` | GPU zero-copy capture→encode. Leave on; it falls back to a CPU path automatically. |
| `SLIPSTREAM_INPUT_BACKEND` | `libei` · `gamescope` · `wlr` · `uinput` | How input is injected. `libei` for GNOME/KDE, `gamescope` for Bazzite. |

## Resolution and refresh rate

You don't set these on the host — **the client chooses them**. When a device connects, the host
creates a virtual display at that device's resolution and refresh rate. A 1080p60 laptop and a
1440p120 desktop each get their own. (With Moonlight, set the mode in Moonlight's settings; with the
Apple app, it uses the device's display.)

## Bitrate

The client requests a bitrate; the host encodes to it. To find a good value for your link:

- **Apple app:** use the built-in **speed test** (a host card's menu → *Test Network Speed*). It
  measures your link and suggests a bitrate, then applies it.
- **Moonlight:** set the bitrate in Moonlight's settings. Start moderate and raise it.

## Multiple devices at once

Today the native `slipstream/1` host (`serve --native`) streams **one session at a time** — additional
clients wait in the accept queue until the active session ends. Each session gets its own virtual
display at the client's exact resolution; concurrent native sessions are on the roadmap.

(`m3-host`, the standalone test host, has a `--max-concurrent N` knob, default 4, bounded by your
GPU's encoder — see the [Host CLI](/docs/host-cli) reference — but `serve --native` does **not** take
that flag.)

## Codec and FEC

- The host encodes **HEVC (H.265)** by default; **AV1** is available for clients that support it.
- The native protocol adds forward error correction for lossy links. `SLIPSTREAM_FEC_PCT=N` sets the
  redundancy percentage (the default is sensible for a normal LAN).

## Diagnostics

- `SLIPSTREAM_PERF=1` logs per-stage timing (capture, encode, send) — handy when tuning latency.
- `RUST_LOG=info` (or `debug`) controls log verbosity.
