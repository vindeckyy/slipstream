title: Client settings
description: Every setting a Slipstream client stores, what it does, what it defaults to, and which of them the host can overrule.
---

The host has [its own settings reference](/docs/configuration). This page is the other half: the
settings each **client** keeps, which together decide what a session looks like.

Most of them are a *request*. The client asks, the host answers, and the answer comes back in the
handshake, so a setting the host can't honor is usually a quiet downgrade rather than an error.

## Where the settings live

The iPhone, Android and Steam Deck (Decky) clients group settings under **General**, **Display**,
**Input**, **Audio**, and **Controllers**. A controller-driven launch (Steam Deck Gaming Mode, or
Android with a pad attached) opens the client's **console home**, whose settings screen is one
steppable list; the Decky plugin has a smaller section of its own. The console home is part of the
client, it is not the host's [web console](/docs/web-console).

On a Steam Deck, Decky writes into `~/.config/slipstream/` so a change in the plugin shows up the
next time that client starts a stream. iPhone and Android use their own app stores.

Changes apply to the **next** session, a running stream keeps what it started with. (*Match window*
is the exception in effect, not in reading: it too is read at connect, but once a session is running
with it on, every window resize renegotiates the mode.)

Not every client offers every setting, and the wording on screen varies a little between them. The
differences that matter are noted per setting.

## Video

**Resolution**, *default: Native display.* The host builds a virtual display at exactly this size
and streams it; nothing is scaled. Native resolves at connect to the mode of the display your window
is on. On iPhone the app may store an explicit size (1920 x 1080 out of the box) with a **Use this
display's mode** control that fills in what you're looking at. If the host has been pinned to stream
a *real* monitor rather than make one, your request is declined and your client scales what it gets,
see [Virtual displays](/docs/virtual-displays#stream-a-real-monitor-instead).

**Match window**, *default: off.* The stream mode follows your window instead, and each resize
renegotiates the host's display and encoder, so a windowed session stays pixel-exact. Fullscreen
degenerates to the display's native mode. Offered where the client has a resizable window; not by
Android or Decky.

**Refresh rate**, *default: Native*, the refresh of the display your window is on. iPhone may store
an explicit rate (60 Hz by default) from the rates the device can display.

**Bitrate**, *default: Automatic.* For H.264, HEVC and AV1, Automatic means the host's own default,
**20 Mbps**, and it turns on two things an explicit rate switches off: adaptive bitrate, and a short
link-capacity probe about two seconds in that measures what your link really carries and lets the
rate climb past 20 Mbps. An explicit rate is fixed for the session, and clamped by the host to
**500 kbps - 8 Gbps**. A host card's menu has a **Test network speed...** entry that measures your link
and suggests a value.

PyroWave is the exception: it has no useful low-rate regime, so its Automatic rate is a fixed
per-pixel budget for the negotiated mode (hundreds of Mbps), and both adaptive bitrate and the
capacity probe stay off for the whole session.

**Render scale**, *default: Native (1x).* The host renders and encodes at your chosen mode
multiplied by this, and your device resamples the result to its window. Above 1x supersamples for
sharpness, at more bandwidth *and* more decode work; below 1x is lighter on both the host and the
link. The stops run 0.5x to 4x. The result is floored to an even size and capped per axis at
4096 px for H.264, 8192 px otherwise. Offered everywhere except the console home's list.

**Video codec**, *default: Automatic.* A soft preference: the host emits your choice when it can
also produce it, otherwise the best codec you both speak, in the order HEVC -> AV1 -> H.264.
**PyroWave** is never auto-picked, pick it explicitly where the client's decode probe passes;
anywhere else it isn't offered, and asking for it lands on that same order. See
[PyroWave](/docs/pyrowave). Android hides AV1 unless the device has a hardware AV1 decoder; Android
never offers PyroWave. iPhone hides AV1 the same way when the device has no hardware AV1 decoder.

**10-bit HDR**, *default: on.* Off means "never send me 10-bit", and the host then never upgrades.
On, the stream goes 10-bit BT.2020 PQ only when the host has HDR content *and* the encoder can do
10-bit. Android disables the toggle, and never advertises HDR, on a panel that can't present HDR10.
Full detail: [HDR](/docs/hdr).

**Full chroma (4:4:4)**, *default: off.* Crisp small text and thin lines, at more bandwidth. It
needs HEVC or PyroWave, the host's own 4:4:4 policy left on, a capture path that delivers full
chroma, and a GPU that can encode it; if any gate fails the host says 4:2:0 before your decoder is
built. **Today only the iPhone app actually advertises 4:4:4**, and only when its hardware decode
probe passes. Android, Decky and the console home don't offer it.

**Host compositor**, *default: Automatic.* Which backend the Linux host uses to drive the virtual
output. Advisory: a host without that backend quietly auto-detects instead.

## Audio

**Audio channels**, *default: Stereo.* You can ask for **5.1** or **7.1**; anything else is read as
stereo. The count the host will really send comes back in the handshake, and your client builds its
decoder from *that*, never from the request. On Linux the host claims a sink advertising exactly that
many channels, so applications produce real surround. Offered everywhere except the Decky plugin.

**Microphone**, *default: off on Android, the console home and Decky; on in the iPhone app.* Sends
this device's microphone to the host's virtual mic.

**Echo cancellation**, *default: on.* Stops the host's audio, playing out of this device's
speakers, from being picked up by the microphone and sent straight back. It hands the microphone
to the system's own canceller rather than doing the work itself: on **iPhone** and **Android** that
is the platform's voice-processing mode. Turn it off if your microphone already runs its own
processing, or if the canceller makes your voice sound thin. The row sits under the microphone
toggle and greys out while the microphone is off. Offered by iPhone, Android and the console home;
Decky has no toggle. What it can and can't fix is in [Why do I hear myself](/docs/echo).

**Speaker** and **Microphone** device pickers are not offered on iPhone, Android, Decky or the
console home; those clients use the system default endpoints.

## Input

Touch modes, mouse modes and the in-stream chords have their own page: [Input](/docs/input). Four
more settings are worth naming here.

**Gamepad type** (*Controller type* on iPhone, Android and the console home), *default: Automatic*,
which matches each physical controller. The pickers offer Xbox 360, Xbox One, DualSense and
DualShock 4 everywhere, plus Steam Deck on Android, the console home and Decky. Your client
declares a type per pad as it connects, Automatic declares what that controller really is, an
explicit choice declares your choice, and the host builds each virtual pad from that. A type the
host has no backend for degrades to an Xbox 360 pad rather than failing (for example any Sony pad on
a host that can't open `/dev/uhid`).

**Forwarded controller** (*Use controller* on iPhone and the console home), *default: Automatic*,
which forwards *every* connected controller, each as its own player. Pinning one restricts the
session to that controller alone, single-player. The Android app has no such picker.

**Capture system shortcuts** is a desktop-client setting and is not part of the iPhone, Android or
Decky product surface.

**Invert scroll direction**, *default: off*, i.e. the host scrolls the way this machine does.

## Behavior

**Auto-wake on connect**, *default: on.* Connecting to a saved host that looks offline sends
Wake-on-LAN and waits for it to boot, only for a host whose MAC address this client has already
learned. Turn it off for hosts you reach over a VPN, where "offline" usually means "not reachable by
broadcast" and the wake only adds a delay. The iPhone and Android apps have this toggle. The console
home has no toggle, it offers wake as an explicit action on an offline host instead, and the Decky
plugin always sends a wake before a stream starts. See [Wake-on-LAN](/docs/wake-on-lan).

**Show game library**, *default: on in the iPhone and Android apps.* Browse a paired host's games
and launch one directly. There is no toggle in the console home or in Decky (Decky uses its own
**Games** / pin flow). See [Game library](/docs/game-library).

**Start streams in fullscreen**, *default: on* where the client has a windowed mode. iPhone and
Android have no equivalent toggle; Decky always launches fullscreen.

## Overlay

**Statistics overlay**, *default: Normal.* Four tiers, Off, Compact, Normal, Detailed, each a
superset of the one before. This setting only picks the tier a session *starts* at, you can cycle
them live in-stream, with a shortcut that differs by platform. The iPhone app additionally lets you
choose which corner the overlay sits in (Top Left, Top Right, Bottom Left, Bottom Right). The Decky
plugin has no stats setting. The shortcuts, and every number in the overlay, are in
[Understanding the stats overlay](/docs/stats).

## Settings that are facts about your device

A few of these describe the machine you're sitting at rather than how you want a host streamed. They
stay global and **cannot be put in a settings profile**:

- **Video decoder** and **GPU**, where the client exposes them. Automatic is vendor-ordered and
  falls back on its own; change it only when debugging, and note that `SLIPSTREAM_DECODER` overrides
  it ([Configuration](/docs/configuration#client-side-native-clients)). iPhone and Android have
  neither picker.
- **Speaker** and **Microphone** device pickers, this device's audio endpoints (where offered).
- **Forwarded controller**, which physical pad is in your hands. The *type* the host creates is a
  preference and can live in a profile; which pad you hold cannot.
- **Auto-wake on connect** and **Show game library**, decisions about this device and this network,
  not about how a given host is streamed.

One switch you might expect here isn't in Settings at all: **Share clipboard** lives in a saved
host's own edit sheet, because handing a machine your clipboard is a decision about that one host,
see [Shared clipboard](/docs/clipboard).

Everything else on this page can be overridden per profile and bound to a host; the rows above are
exactly [what a profile can't change](/docs/profiles-and-links#what-a-profile-cant-change).

## When the client and the host disagree

| You ask for | What the host does |
|---|---|
| Resolution and refresh | Builds a display at exactly that mode. A host pinned to a real monitor keeps that monitor's resolution and you scale locally. A size the encoder can't take, odd, or past the codec's per-axis limit, fails the connect rather than being quietly changed. |
| A bitrate | Clamps it to 500 kbps - 8 Gbps, or uses its 20 Mbps default for Automatic (a per-pixel budget for Automatic PyroWave). |
| A codec | Honors it when it can encode it, else the best shared codec in the order HEVC -> AV1 -> H.264. |
| 10-bit HDR | Upgrades only for HDR content on an encoder that can do 10-bit; otherwise 8-bit SDR. |
| 4:4:4 chroma | Sends it only when every gate passes; otherwise 4:2:0. |
| A channel count | Normalizes it to 2, 6 or 8. |
| A gamepad type | Uses it as the session default; an unsupported type becomes an Xbox 360 pad. |
| A compositor | Treats it as advisory and auto-detects when it isn't available. |

Every one of those answers arrives before your decoder and speakers are set up, so what you see and
hear is built from what the host really sent, never from what you asked for.
