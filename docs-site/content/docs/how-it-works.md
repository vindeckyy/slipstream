description: The ideas behind Slipstream, per-client virtual displays, the two protocols, and trust.

You don't need to know any of this to use Slipstream, but it helps to understand what's happening
when you connect.

## A virtual display, sized to your device

When a client connects, the host asks your desktop to create a **new virtual display** at exactly the
client's resolution and refresh rate, captures that display, and streams it. The virtual display is
real to your desktop, apps can be moved onto it, games open on it, but it isn't tied to any physical
monitor. When the client disconnects, the virtual display goes away.

That's why a 1080p60 laptop and a 1440p120 desktop can stream from the same host **at the same time**,
each at its own mode, they each get their own virtual display.

How the virtual display is created depends on your host:

| Host | How |
|---|---|
| **GNOME** (Mutter) | A virtual monitor via the screen-cast API |
| **KDE Plasma** (KWin) | A virtual output via KWin's screencast |
| **Bazzite / Steam** (gamescope) | A nested gamescope session launched at the client's mode |
| **[Hyprland](/docs/hyprland)** | A headless output added with `hyprctl`, captured through xdg-desktop-portal-hyprland |
| **Sway** (wlroots) | A headless output added to the running session |
| **Windows** | A virtual-display driver, including Slipstream's own **indirect display driver** the host pushes frames straight into, a real virtual display, no physical monitor, even on the secure desktop |

That last one is the distinctive part on Windows: rather than only capturing an existing screen,
Slipstream has **its own indirect display driver (IDD)**, and the host can push finished frames
**straight into the driver**. You get the same on-the-fly virtual display the Linux compositors give
you, at the client's exact mode, with no physical monitor or dummy HDMI dongle, and even on the
secure desktop (UAC / lock screen). That tight, push-based integration is unusual among Windows
streaming hosts.

## From screen to GPU to wire

Captured frames never touch the CPU on their way to the encoder, a **zero-copy GPU path** that keeps
latency low even at high resolutions and frame rates.

Which encoder runs depends on your GPU: **NVIDIA** -> NVENC on both platforms; **AMD** -> AMF and
**Intel** -> QSV on Windows. On Linux AMD and Intel share one path, **Vulkan Video** for HEVC and
AV1, with **VAAPI** for H.264 and as the fallback when Vulkan encode isn't available. There's also a
GPU-less software H.264 encoder: on Windows the host picks it when it finds no supported GPU, and on
Linux you turn it on yourself (`SLIPSTREAM_ENCODER=software`, see [Configuration](/docs/configuration)).

Client and host then negotiate the codec: **HEVC** by default, **AV1** where both sides support it,
**H.264** on the software path, and, if you pick it on a wired link, **[PyroWave](/docs/pyrowave)**,
an intra-only wavelet codec that trades bandwidth for a fraction of a millisecond of codec latency.
**HDR** (10-bit BT.2020 PQ) rides the same path where the host's capture, its encoder, the codec and
your client all allow it; [HDR](/docs/hdr) has the four-link chain and what each host and client can
really do.

## Two protocols

Slipstream speaks two protocols over the same host:

- **GameStream**, the protocol Moonlight uses. Start the host with `--gamestream` and any
  [Moonlight](/docs/moonlight) client connects with no special software. This is the most compatible way in.
- **slipstream/1 (native)**, a purpose-built protocol with a QUIC control channel and a UDP data
  channel hardened with forward error correction and encryption. It's lower-latency and more resilient
  on imperfect networks, and it's what the [native clients](/docs/clients) (Apple, Linux, Windows,
  Android) use.

The native `slipstream/1` plane runs by default (the secure default); add `--gamestream` and both planes
serve from a single host process, Moonlight clients use GameStream, the native clients use slipstream/1.

## Pairing and trust

The first time a device connects, you pair it: the host shows a short **PIN**, you type it into the
client, and the two remember each other. After that the device reconnects automatically on a pinned
cryptographic identity, no PIN, no account, no cloud. See [Pairing & Trust](/docs/pairing).

## Finding hosts

Hosts advertise themselves on your local network, so clients can **discover** them automatically
instead of needing an IP address. The native clients and Moonlight both list hosts they find on the
LAN.

## Multiple devices at once

A host can stream to several clients simultaneously, your laptop and your TV both viewing (and
controlling) the desktop, each at its own resolution. See [Multiple devices](/docs/configuration#multiple-devices-at-once).
