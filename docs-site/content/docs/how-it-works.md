description: The ideas behind slipstream — per-client virtual displays, the two protocols, and trust.

You don't need to know any of this to use slipstream, but it helps to understand what's happening
when you connect.

## A virtual display, sized to your device

When a client connects, the host asks your desktop to create a **new virtual display** at exactly the
client's resolution and refresh rate, captures that display, and streams it. The virtual display is
real to your desktop — apps can be moved onto it, games open on it — but it isn't tied to any physical
monitor. When the client disconnects, the virtual display goes away.

That's why a 1080p60 laptop and a 1440p120 desktop can stream from the same host **at the same time**,
each at its own mode — they each get their own virtual display.

How the virtual display is created depends on your host:

| Host | How |
|---|---|
| **GNOME** (Mutter) | A virtual monitor via the screen-cast API |
| **KDE Plasma** (KWin) | A virtual output via KWin's screencast |
| **Bazzite / Steam** (gamescope) | A nested gamescope session launched at the client's mode |
| **Sway** (wlroots) | A headless output added to the running session |
| **Windows** | A virtual-display driver — including slipstream's own **indirect display driver** the host pushes frames straight into — a real virtual display, no physical monitor, even on the secure desktop |

That last one is the distinctive part on Windows: rather than only capturing an existing screen,
slipstream has **its own indirect display driver (IDD)**, and the host can push finished frames
**straight into the driver**. You get the same on-the-fly virtual display the Linux compositors give
you — at the client's exact mode, with no physical monitor or dummy HDMI dongle, and even on the
secure desktop (UAC / lock screen). That tight, push-based integration is unusual among Windows
streaming hosts.

## From screen to GPU to wire

Captured frames never touch the CPU on their way to the encoder. They go straight from the
compositor to the GPU's NVENC hardware encoder (HEVC/H.264/AV1) and out to the network — a **zero-copy
GPU path** that keeps latency low even at high resolutions and frame rates.

## Two protocols

slipstream speaks two protocols over the same host:

- **GameStream** — the protocol Moonlight uses. Any [Moonlight](/docs/moonlight) client connects with
  no special software. This is the most compatible way in.
- **slipstream/1 (native)** — a purpose-built protocol with a QUIC control channel and a UDP data
  channel hardened with forward error correction and encryption. It's lower-latency and more resilient
  on imperfect networks, and it's what the [native clients](/docs/clients) (Apple, Linux, Windows,
  Android) use.

Both run from a single host process, so you don't choose up front — Moonlight clients use GameStream,
the native clients use slipstream/1.

## Pairing and trust

The first time a device connects, you pair it: the host shows a short **PIN**, you type it into the
client, and the two remember each other. After that the device reconnects automatically on a pinned
cryptographic identity — no PIN, no account, no cloud. See [Pairing & Trust](/docs/pairing).

## Finding hosts

Hosts advertise themselves on your local network, so clients can **discover** them automatically
instead of needing an IP address. The native clients and Moonlight both list hosts they find on the
LAN.

## Multiple devices at once

A host can stream to several clients simultaneously — your laptop and your TV both viewing (and
controlling) the desktop, each at its own resolution. See [Multiple devices](/docs/configuration#multiple-devices).
