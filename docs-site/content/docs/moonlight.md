title: Connect with Moonlight
description: Stream from a slipstream host using any Moonlight client.
---

slipstream speaks the **GameStream** protocol, so [Moonlight](https://moonlight-stream.org/) connects
to it like it would to any GameStream host — no slipstream-specific app needed. This is the easiest way
to stream to Windows, Android, the Steam Deck, a browser, or a TV.

## 1. Make sure the host is running

On the host machine, `serve --native` (or your [service](/docs/running-as-a-service)) should be up.
The host advertises itself on the network, so Moonlight usually finds it on its own.

## 2. Add the host in Moonlight

Open Moonlight. Your host should appear automatically on the same network. If it doesn't, use **Add
Host manually** and enter the host machine's IP address.

## 3. Pair

Select the host and choose **Pair**. Moonlight shows a 4-digit PIN. On the host, you confirm pairing
(from the web console, or it accepts the ceremony when armed) — see [Pairing & Trust](/docs/pairing).
Once paired, Moonlight remembers the host.

## 4. Stream

Pick an app/desktop and start streaming. The host creates a virtual display at the resolution and
frame rate Moonlight requests (set these in Moonlight's settings), encodes it on the GPU, and streams
it. Mouse, keyboard, and controllers flow back to the host.

## Tips

- **Set your resolution and frame rate in Moonlight's settings** before connecting — the host matches
  whatever Moonlight asks for, creating the virtual display at that exact mode.
- **Codec:** HEVC (H.265) is a good default; AV1 is available if your client supports it.
- **Bitrate:** start moderate and raise it. For very high bitrates, the native [Apple
  app](/docs/clients) has a built-in speed test; with Moonlight, set the bitrate manually.
- Moonlight uses the GameStream protocol, not slipstream's native FEC/encryption extensions. On a
  solid LAN this is fine; on a lossy link the [Apple app](/docs/clients) holds up better.
