description: Configure a slipstream host on a Hyprland session — headless output via hyprctl, capture via xdg-desktop-portal-hyprland.
---

Hyprland is a **first-class backend.** The host adds a per-client headless output at the client's
exact mode with `hyprctl`, captures it through the **xdg-desktop-portal-hyprland (xdph)** ScreenCast
portal (zero-copy dmabuf), and injects input via the wlroots virtual pointer/keyboard protocols —
which Hyprland still implements even after dropping wlroots in v0.42.

This is a distinct backend from [Sway / wlroots](/docs/sway): Hyprland has its own IPC (`hyprctl`)
and its own portal (xdph), so it is auto-detected and driven separately.

This page assumes the package is already installed — see [Arch](/docs/arch), [Ubuntu](/docs/ubuntu),
or [Fedora](/docs/fedora).

## host.env

The host auto-detects a Hyprland session, so the starter `~/.config/slipstream/host.env` is one line:

```ini
SLIPSTREAM_VIDEO_SOURCE=virtual
# GPU zero-copy capture→encode is ON by default; auto-falls back to CPU. Set SLIPSTREAM_ZEROCOPY=0 to force CPU.
```

To force the backend (CI/testing — note that pinning turns live-session auto-detection **off**, so
the host stops following session switches):

```ini
SLIPSTREAM_COMPOSITOR=hyprland
SLIPSTREAM_INPUT_BACKEND=wlr
```

See [Configuration](/docs/configuration) for the full reference.

## How it works

- **Video** — the host runs `hyprctl output create headless PF-1` and applies a monitor rule for the
  client's exact mode. Outputs are **named**, so there's no before/after diffing. The rule uses
  `hyprctl keyword monitor …` (the hyprlang config manager — the default on every release, 0.55
  included) and falls back to the Lua `hyprctl eval 'hl.monitor{…}'` only if you've opted into the
  Lua config manager. The host confirms the output actually adopted the mode before streaming.
- **Capture** — it captures that output through the **xdg-desktop-portal-hyprland (xdph)** ScreenCast
  portal. To pick the output without a GUI on a headless host, the host writes a managed
  `~/.config/hypr/xdph.conf` pointing xdph's `custom_picker_binary` at a small shim that selects the
  new output automatically — no interactive picker dialog to answer.
- **Input** — mouse and keyboard are injected via the wlroots **virtual pointer** and **virtual
  keyboard** protocols (Hyprland kept them). Gamepads and audio are compositor-independent.

For how long the virtual output lives, and extend-vs-exclusive topology, see
[Virtual displays](/docs/virtual-displays).

## Requirements

- A running Hyprland session (the `hyprctl`/xdph contracts are verified on **0.55.4**; older
  releases share the same `hyprctl` surface).
- **xdg-desktop-portal-hyprland (xdph)** installed and running — the host captures through its
  ScreenCast portal, and steers its custom picker. Without it there is no video.
- The ScreenCast interface routed to xdph — see `scripts/headless/portals.conf` (a `[Hyprland]`
  section pins `org.freedesktop.impl.portal.ScreenCast=hyprland`).

## Troubleshooting: black / no video (headless output at 0×0)

A headless output only gets a framebuffer once the compositor can allocate one. On some GPU/driver
combinations (notably NVIDIA, and in nested test setups) that GBM/dmabuf allocation fails and the
output stays `0×0` — you'll see `GBM: Failed to allocate a GBM buffer: bo null` in the Hyprland log
(cf. [Sunshine #4197](https://github.com/LizardByte/Sunshine/issues/4197)). The host detects this
and fails the session with a clear error rather than streaming a blank surface. If you hit it,
capture the Hyprland log (`hyprctl` instance dir → `hyprland.log`) and check your GPU's GBM support;
running Hyprland as a real session (not nested) is the supported configuration.

## Permission system

Hyprland's permission system (`ecosystem.enforce_permissions`, 0.49+, **off by default**) can deny
direct screencopy and virtual-input clients — and denial is **silent**: capture goes to *black
frames* and input is *dropped*, with no error. If you've enabled it, grant the host explicitly in
your Hyprland config:

```ini
ecosystem {
    enforce_permissions = true
}

permission = /usr/bin/slipstream-host, screencopy, allow
permission = /usr/bin/slipstream-host, virtual-pointer, allow
permission = /usr/bin/slipstream-host, virtual-keyboard, allow
```

The host logs a warning at startup when it detects enforcement is on. (Adjust the binary path to
where your package installed `slipstream-host`.)

## Start the host

With the backend selected, start the host from **inside your Hyprland session**:

```sh
systemctl --user enable --now slipstream-host
journalctl --user -u slipstream-host -f
```

## Bring up the console and pair

Enable the web console, read its login password, and arm PIN pairing — see
[The Web Console](/docs/web-console). Then [connect a client](/docs/clients).
