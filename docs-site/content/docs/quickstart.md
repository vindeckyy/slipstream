description: From nothing to streaming — set up a host and connect your first client.

This is the shortest path to a working stream. Each step links to the details.

> A streaming host is remote control of the machine, so it's built for **trusted local networks** — keep
> it on your LAN or a VPN and don't expose it to the internet. Two minutes on
> [Security & Safe Use](/docs/security) before you start is worth it.

## 1. Set up the host

On your gaming machine (NVIDIA, AMD, or Intel GPU), follow the install guide for your system:

- [Ubuntu / Debian](/docs/ubuntu)
- [Fedora](/docs/fedora)
- [Arch](/docs/arch)
- [Bazzite](/docs/bazzite)
- [SteamOS](/docs/steamos-host)
- [Windows host](/docs/windows-host)

Each one covers the GPU driver, the dependencies, and how to install and run the host. After
installing, configure for your desktop ([KDE](/docs/kde) / [GNOME](/docs/gnome) /
[gamescope](/docs/gamescope) / [Sway](/docs/sway)). Check the [Requirements](/docs/requirements)
first if you're not sure your machine is a fit.

## 2. Start the host

From a terminal **inside your desktop session** (so the host can reach your compositor):

```sh
slipstream-host serve
```

This is the secure native-only default — the native `slipstream/1` plane plus the web console. To also
serve stock Moonlight clients, add `--gamestream` (trusted-LAN only; see [Moonlight](/docs/moonlight)).
The host starts listening and prints its identity fingerprint. It advertises itself on your local
network, so clients can find it by name. Leave it running. (To start it automatically at boot, see
[Running as a Service](/docs/running-as-a-service).)

## 3. Connect and pair a client

On the device you want to stream to, use a [native slipstream client](/docs/clients) for the lowest
latency, or any Moonlight client:

- **Native client (Apple, Linux, Windows, Android):** open the slipstream app — your host appears in
  the list of hosts found on your network. Select it, and when prompted, **pair**.
- **Anything with Moonlight:** add the host (it should be discovered automatically), then pair.

To pair, the host needs to show a PIN. [Arm pairing](/docs/web-console#arm-pairing) from the host's
web console — the host displays a 4-digit PIN, you type it into the client, and they trust each other
from then on. Pairing is required by default. Full details: [Pairing & Trust](/docs/pairing).

## 4. Stream

Once paired, select the host and start streaming. The host creates a virtual display at your device's
resolution and refresh, and the picture comes up. Mouse, keyboard, and controllers flow back to the
host.

## Next steps

- Tune [resolution, refresh, and bitrate](/docs/configuration).
- Run the host [as a background service](/docs/running-as-a-service) so it's always available.
- Hit a snag? See [Troubleshooting](/docs/troubleshooting).
