title: Sway / wlroots
description: Configure a slipstream host on a wlroots compositor (Sway, Hyprland).
---

The wlroots family can host — but **Sway is the only validated path.** The host adds a per-client
headless output at the client's exact mode and captures it through the xdg-desktop-portal-wlr (xdpw)
ScreenCast portal, injecting input via the wlroots virtual pointer/keyboard protocols. Hyprland and
other wlroots compositors are best-effort (see [How it works](#how-it-works) for the caveat).

This is **not a primary target.** It works and is validated live on **sway 1.11** (zero-copy), but it
sees far less testing than the KDE and GNOME paths — expect rougher edges. If you have a choice,
[KDE](/docs/kde) or [GNOME](/docs/gnome) are the better-exercised desktops.

This page assumes the package is already installed — see [Arch](/docs/arch), [Ubuntu](/docs/ubuntu),
or [Fedora](/docs/fedora).

## host.env

The host auto-detects a wlroots session, so you usually need nothing here. To force the backend, set
these in `~/.config/slipstream/host.env`:

```ini
SLIPSTREAM_COMPOSITOR=wlroots      # aliases: sway, hyprland
SLIPSTREAM_INPUT_BACKEND=wlr
SLIPSTREAM_VIDEO_SOURCE=virtual
SLIPSTREAM_ZEROCOPY=1              # GPU zero-copy capture→encode; auto-falls back to CPU
```

See [Configuration](/docs/configuration) for the full reference.

## How it works

- **Video** — the host adds a headless output at the client's exact mode with `swaymsg create_output`.
  This uses Sway's IPC specifically; other wlroots compositors (Hyprland, …) don't expose an
  equivalent, so virtual-output creation isn't wired up for them yet — Sway is the supported wlroots
  path today.
- **Capture** — it captures that output through the **xdg-desktop-portal-wlr (xdpw)** ScreenCast
  portal. The host writes a managed chooser config so the output pick is automatic — no interactive
  picker dialog to answer.
- **Input** — mouse and keyboard are injected via the wlroots **virtual pointer** and **virtual
  keyboard** protocols.

For how long the virtual output lives, and extend-vs-exclusive topology, see
[Virtual displays](/docs/virtual-displays).

## Requirements

- A running wlroots session (Sway, Hyprland, …).
- **xdg-desktop-portal-wlr (xdpw)** installed and running — the host captures through its ScreenCast
  portal. Without it there is no video.

## Start the host

With the backend selected, start the host from **inside your Sway session**:

```sh
systemctl --user enable --now slipstream-host
journalctl --user -u slipstream-host -f
```

## Bring up the console and pair

Enable the web console, read its login password, and arm PIN pairing — see
[The Web Console](/docs/web-console). Then [connect a client](/docs/clients).
