# `slipstream-gamescope` — nixpkgs' gamescope carrying slipstream's `pipewire-hdr` patches, exposed
# under its own name so it sits BESIDE the system gamescope instead of replacing it.
#
# An override rather than a from-scratch derivation on purpose: gamescope vendors wlroots,
# vkroots, libliftoff, libdisplay-info, SPIRV-Headers and reshade as git submodules plus two meson
# wraps, and nixpkgs already solves all of that. What we add is the patch set and a rename.
#
# This is also why the override needs none of the `force_fallback_for` armour
# `build-slipstream-gamescope.sh` carries: that exists because meson silently prefers a SYSTEM
# wlroots when the build host has one and links it shared, producing a binary that starts only on
# machines with that dev library. A nix closure names every library it links, so the outcome is
# whatever nixpkgs' own gamescope already does — reproducibly.
#
# `gamescope` in nixpkgs is a wrapper (it wires the WSI layer + capabilities); the buildable
# derivation is `gamescope.unwrapped` — patching the wrapper would be a no-op, so this asserts on
# it rather than silently shipping an unpatched binary.
#
# Version drift: the patches are applied to whatever gamescope your nixpkgs pins, NOT to the
# commit `packaging/gamescope/build-slipstream-gamescope.sh` names. Both hunks sit in code that has
# been stable across the 3.16 series (`src/pipewire.cpp`'s format builders, `paint_pipewire()` in
# `src/steamcompmgr.cpp`), so this normally just works — and when it does not, the build fails
# loudly at `patchPhase` rather than producing a gamescope that quietly cannot do HDR.

  # our own name — the single worst outcome here, because the host reads the name as a promise of

  # fails at eval, before anything is built.)
