# slipstream Nix packages — built with crane (github:ipetkov/crane).
#
# Two derivations, mirroring the RPM's `slipstream` / `slipstream-client` split (packaging/rpm/
# slipstream.spec) so a headless streaming host never drags in the GTK client closure:
#
#   * slipstream-host   — the streaming host + status tray (slipstream-host, slipstream-tray).
#                        Built with the same feature set CI ships: the direct-SDK NVENC path
#                        (`nvenc`) + the raw Vulkan-Video HEVC encoder (`vulkan-encode`). Both are
#                        AMD/Intel-safe (NVENC/CUDA entry points are dlopen'd at RUNTIME, never
#                        link-imported), so ONE binary runs on NVIDIA, AMD and Intel.
#   * slipstream-client — the native Linux client: the GTK4/libadwaita shell (slipstream-client) plus
#                        the Vulkan/ash session streamer it execs (slipstream-session).
#
# Why crane and not rustPlatform.buildRustPackage:
#   * The lockfile carries `windows 0.62.2` (and friends) from BOTH crates.io AND a pinned
#     microsoft/windows-rs git rev — the Windows client uses the git one. importCargoLock keys its
#     vendor dir by `name-version`, so those same-name-same-version-different-source entries collide;
#     crane vendors per-source and handles it. (Those crates are `cfg(windows)`-gated and never
#     COMPILE on Linux — they only need to be vendored to satisfy the lock.)
#   * crane fetches git deps with `builtins.fetchGit` (the rev is a full sha ⇒ pure-eval-safe), so
#     no hand-maintained `outputHashes` for the windows-rs checkout.
#
# The whole workspace is built from real source (no crane dep-only "dummy" pre-build): pyrowave-sys
# runs CMake over its committed `vendor/pyrowave` tree in build.rs, which a dummy src would omit —
# so `cargoArtifacts = null` keeps deps + crate in one derivation.
