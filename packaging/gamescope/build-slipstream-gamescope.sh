# Build gamescope + slipstream's `pipewire-hdr` patches and install it as `slipstream-gamescope`.
#
# The ONE build recipe every packaging path calls (Arch PKGBUILD, the Bazzite sysext image, an
# operator building by hand); the nix derivation expresses the same thing declaratively. It never
# touches the distro's own `gamescope` — the binary lands under a different name, and the host's
# resolution order (SLIPSTREAM_GAMESCOPE_BIN > slipstream-gamescope > gamescope) picks it up.
#
# Usage:
#   bash build-slipstream-gamescope.sh [--rev <git-rev>] [--prefix /usr] [--destdir DIR]
#                                     [--srcdir DIR] [--jobs N] [--no-setcap]
#
#   --rev       gamescope commit/tag to build (default: the pin below)
#   --prefix    install prefix (default /usr)
#   --destdir   staging root for packaging (default: install straight into --prefix)
#   --srcdir    reuse an existing gamescope checkout instead of cloning
#   --no-setcap skip CAP_SYS_NICE (always skipped when --destdir is set — a package sets it)
#
# Needs: git, meson >= 0.58, ninja, a C++20 compiler, and gamescope's own build deps. Those vary
# by distro; the packaging files list them (packaging/gamescope/PKGBUILD for Arch). gamescope
# vendors wlroots / libliftoff / vkroots / libdisplay-info / SPIRV-Headers / reshade as git
# SUBMODULES (plus two meson wraps for glm + stb), so both the clone and the build want network
# access unless the checkout already carries them — hence `--recurse-submodules` below.
set -euo pipefail

# The pinned upstream. Bump together with the patches (they are `git am`-able and rebase cheaply —
# two files, mirroring code that already exists in-tree; see README.md).

# We ship ONE binary out of this tree, so build only what leads to it:
#   -Denable_tests=false        gamescope's own unit tests want Catch2 **v3**
#                               (`catch2-with-main`); Fedora ships v2, and building someone else's
#                               test suite is not our job either way.
#   -Denable_openvr_support     the VR integration pulls the openvr submodule + its build for a
#                               code path a headless capture session never enters.
#   -Denable_gamescope_wsi_layer the WSI layer is a SEPARATE artifact the distro's gamescope
#                               package already installs; ours must not collide with it.
#                               (The layer the nested games load is that one — it is version-
#                               independent of the compositor binary.)
#
# `force_fallback_for` includes **wlroots** on purpose, and it is load-bearing for a binary we
# SHIP: gamescope vendors a wlroots submodule, but meson prefers a system one when the build host
# happens to have `wlroots-devel` — and then links it SHARED. The result starts fine on the build
# host and dies with `libwlroots-0.19.so: cannot open shared object file` anywhere else, which is
# every machine that installs our package. Fedora 43 has no wlroots-devel so it fell back and
# linked static by luck; Fedora 44's `dnf builddep gamescope` pulls one in, and the binary built
# there would not start on the host. Pinning the fallback makes the outcome the same everywhere.
# (gamescope's own meson.build hard-errors if libliftoff/vkroots are missing from this list, so
# all three go together.)
#
# The C++ runtime goes STATIC for the same reason wlroots does: this binary is built on a ROLLING
# distro and has to start on a FROZEN one. Arch's gcc (16.1.1 when this was written) makes the
# compositor require `GLIBCXX_3.4.35`, and SteamOS 3.8.16 ships libstdc++ 3.4.34 — so the published
# Arch package died on the very platform the gamescope backend matters most on ("version
# GLIBCXX_3.4.35 not found"), while every other soname resolved and glibc was never close to the
# limit (the binary asks for 2.38 at most; SteamOS has 2.41). Safe because
# gamescope links NO shared C++ library (its `NEEDED` list is all C — glslang/SPIRV are build-time
# only), so no C++ ABI ever crosses a shared boundary; it costs ~1 MB.
# Appended to LDFLAGS rather than passed as `-Dcpp_link_args`, because that option would REPLACE
# the value meson derives from the environment and silently drop makepkg's hardening flags
# (`-z relro`, `-z now`, `--as-needed`).
