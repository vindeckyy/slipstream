# slipstream-sysext — install/update the slipstream host on Bazzite / Fedora Atomic as a
# systemd-sysext, the no-layering path (rpm-ostree layering is a last resort per the Bazzite
# docs: it slows every update and can block upgrades; a sysext never enters an rpm-ostree
# transaction, needs no reboot, and is trivially removable).
#
# The image overlays /usr from /var/lib/extensions/slipstream.raw with the host, tray and web
# console + their udev/sysctl/systemd-user payload; the RPMs' two /etc files (gamescope
# session drop-in, tray autostart) ride inside at /usr/share/slipstream/etc/ and are copied
# into the real /etc here (a sysext can only carry /usr).
#
# Bootstrap (the script also ships inside the image as /usr/bin/slipstream-sysext):
#   curl -fsSLO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vindeckyy/slipstream/main/packaging/bazzite/slipstream-sysext.sh
#   sudo bash slipstream-sysext.sh install            # or: install --channel canary
# Thereafter:
#   sudo slipstream-sysext update | status | remove
#
# Feed: set SLIPSTREAM_SYSEXT_REGISTRY to the base URL of your sysext feed (one feed per
# Fedora major x channel under that base: …/f43/, f43-canary, f44, …), each a SHA256SUMS +
# SHA256SUMS.asc + versioned .raw files. There is no baked-in public default; private setups
# typically point this at a generic package registry or a GitHub Releases-mirrored path.
# Published historically by .github/workflows/rpm.yml from the same RPMs the (legacy) layering
# path uses. The image pins ID=fedora + VERSION_ID, so after a major OS rebase the old image is
# refused (not merged broken) and `slipstream-sysext update` re-resolves against the new release.
#
# Trust: SHA256SUMS carries a detached OpenPGP signature (SHA256SUMS.asc) from packages@unom.io —
# the same key that signs our RPMs — and this script verifies it before believing a word of the
# manifest. The checksums alone could never have done that: they live on the same registry as the
# images they describe, so anything able to replace an image could replace its checksum too. The
# public key is baked in below rather than fetched, because a key fetched from the thing you are
# authenticating authenticates nothing.
