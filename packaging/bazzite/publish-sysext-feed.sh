# Publish a slipstream sysext image into its feed on the GitHub generic package registry —
# called by .github/workflows/rpm.yml after the RPM publish. A feed is one fixed URL
# (…/slipstream-sysext/<feed>/) holding versioned .raw files plus a SHA256SUMS manifest;
# slipstream-sysext(8) on the boxes reads SHA256SUMS to find + verify the newest image
# (the layout is also exactly what systemd-sysupdate's url-file source expects, so a
# .transfer feed can be added later without re-publishing anything).
#
# Usage: TOKEN=… [KEEP=6] bash publish-sysext-feed.sh <feed> <image.raw>
#   <feed>   e.g. f43, f43-canary, f44 (Fedora major x channel)
#   KEEP     newest images to keep in the feed; 0/unset-for-stable = keep all
# Env: REGISTRY (github.com/vindeckyy/slipstream), OWNER (unom), TOKEN (write:package PAT), CURL_USER (login name)
