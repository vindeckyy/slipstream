#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Publish a slipstream sysext image into its feed on the GitHub generic package registry —
# called by .github/workflows/rpm.yml after the RPM publish. A feed is one fixed URL
# (…/slipstream-sysext/<feed>/) holding versioned .raw files plus a SHA256SUMS manifest and its
# detached OpenPGP signature SHA256SUMS.asc; slipstream-sysext(8) on the boxes verifies that
# signature, then uses the manifest to find + check the newest image (the layout is also exactly
# what systemd-sysupdate's url-file source expects, so a .transfer feed can be added later
# without re-publishing anything).
#
# Signing uses RPM_GPG_PRIVATE_KEY — the SAME packages@unom.io key that signs the RPMs, so boxes
# have one key to trust and we have one key to rotate. Without checksums-plus-signature the feed
# was self-certifying: SHA256SUMS sits on the same registry as the images it describes, so whoever
# could swap an image could swap its checksum in the same breath.
#
# Usage: TOKEN=… [KEEP=6] bash publish-sysext-feed.sh <feed> <image.raw>
#        TOKEN=… bash publish-sysext-feed.sh --seal <feed>
#   <feed>   e.g. f43, f43-canary, f44 (Fedora major x channel)
#   KEEP     newest images to keep in the feed; 0/unset-for-stable = keep all
#   --seal   re-sign a feed's EXISTING manifest without publishing an image. For feeds published
#            before signing existed, and after a key rotation. Idempotent.
# Env: REGISTRY (github.com/vindeckyy/slipstream), OWNER (unom), TOKEN (write:package PAT), CURL_USER (login name),
