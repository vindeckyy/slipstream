# The VIRTUAL OUTPUT (video) needs no setup: the host package ships io.slipstream.Host.desktop,
# whose X-KDE-Wayland-Interfaces grants the host KWin's restricted zkde_screencast protocol on a
# normal interactive Plasma session — least-privilege (only the host, only that interface), the same
# mechanism krfb/krdp use. No session-wide KWIN_WAYLAND_NO_PERMISSION_CHECKS hack is needed. KWin
# caches the grant per-executable on first connect, so after a FRESH host install log out + back into
# the Desktop session once so KWin re-reads the file.
#
# The one thing a normal KDE login still lacks is the `kde-authorized` RemoteDesktop grant — so the
# host's libei input setup auto-approves instead of popping an "Allow remote control?" dialog the
# headless host can't answer. That's what this script seeds.
