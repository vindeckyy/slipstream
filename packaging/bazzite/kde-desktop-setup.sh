# output at the client's resolution). Run ONCE as the streaming user (no root needed). Gaming Mode

# Two things a normal KDE login lacks that the headless host needs:
#  1. KWIN_WAYLAND_NO_PERMISSION_CHECKS=1 — so KWin exposes the privileged `zkde_screencast`
#     virtual-output protocol to the host (an external client) at all.
#  2. The `kde-authorized` RemoteDesktop grant — so libei input setup auto-approves instead of
#     popping an "Allow remote control?" dialog the headless host can't answer.
# After running, log out + back into the KDE Desktop session once (or reboot) so KWin restarts
# with the flag. Gaming Mode is unaffected.
