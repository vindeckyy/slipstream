# Build the slipstream systemd-sysext image for Bazzite / Fedora Atomic from the built RPMs —
# the no-layering install path (rpm-ostree layering slows every update and can block upgrades;
# a sysext never enters an rpm-ostree transaction). The .raw overlays /usr read-only from
# /var/lib/extensions/, survives OS updates, and is toggled/updated without a reboot.
#
# Counterpart to ../arch/build-sysext.sh (which wraps a pacman package for SteamOS). This one
# wraps the Fedora RPMs (slipstream + slipstream-web) and additionally:
#   * relocates the RPMs' /etc payload to /usr/share/slipstream/etc/ (a sysext carries ONLY /usr;
#     slipstream-sysext(8) copies these into the real /etc on install),
#   * bakes SELinux labels in as squashfs pseudo-xattrs, computed with matchpathcon from the
#     build container's targeted policy. Without them every file is unlabeled_t at runtime:
#     fine for the user session + systemd --user units (unconfined), but system daemons are
#     DENIED — udev couldn't read 60-slipstream.rules and systemd-sysctl couldn't read the
#     sysctl drop-in (validated live on Bazzite 43, SELinux enforcing, 2026-07-04),
#   * pins compatibility via ID=fedora + VERSION_ID: merges on Bazzite/Silverblue/Aurora of the
#     SAME Fedora major (ID_LIKE matching, systemd >= 256) and is REFUSED after a major rebase
#     instead of running soname-broken binaries (`slipstream-sysext update` then re-resolves),
#   * embeds the slipstream-sysext helper so an installed box can update itself.
#
# Build in the matching Fedora container (ci/fedora*-rpm.Dockerfile) — matchpathcon needs the
# Fedora targeted policy (libselinux-utils + selinux-policy-targeted), and the RPMs are
# soname-coupled to their base anyway. Needs: rpm2cpio, cpio, mksquashfs (>= 4.6), matchpathcon.
#
# Usage:
#   bash build-sysext.sh --version-id 43 --out dist/slipstream-0.7.1-1-x86-64.raw \
#        dist/slipstream-0.7.1-1.fc43.x86_64.rpm dist/slipstream-web-0.7.1-1.fc43.noarch.rpm
#
# The installed image MUST be named slipstream.raw (the embedded extension-release marker is
# extension-release.slipstream; systemd-sysext requires marker == image name) — the feed carries
# versioned filenames and slipstream-sysext installs to the fixed name.
