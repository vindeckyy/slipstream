# ACTIVE: RPM_GPG_PRIVATE_KEY is set as an ORG-level secret on `unom` (packages@unom.io,
# AF245C506F4E4763  -  the public half is committed at packaging/rpm/RPM-GPG-KEY-slipstream and served
# from the registry). Every published RPM carries its EdDSA header signature; the repo file in
# README.md tells users gpgcheck=1, which only works because of that.
#
# Without the key this exits 0 and leaves the RPMs unsigned, so a fork or a local build still works
#  -  but NOT on a release. On refs/tags/v* a missing key is a hard failure: an org secret that got
# rotated, renamed, or not inherited would otherwise publish an unsigned release into a repo whose
# own instructions say gpgcheck=1, and every user's `dnf upgrade` would break on it. Better to fail
# the build than to find out from users. This keeps release package signing fail-closed.
#
# Requires a DEDICATED, PASSPHRASE-LESS signing key (the one the runbook generates with
# %no-protection), distinct from the GitHub instance's repo-metadata key  -  rpm's default signer
# can't supply a passphrase non-interactively here.
#
# Usage (in rpm.yml, after build-rpm.sh): RPM_GPG_PRIVATE_KEY=... bash packaging/rpm/sign-rpms.sh
