# slipstream — low-latency desktop/game streaming host (RPM for Fedora / Bazzite)
#
# Builds `slipstream-host` from source with cargo and installs the binary, the
# uinput udev rule (virtual gamepads), the systemd *user* unit, and the headless
# session helpers. Designed for COPR (build-from-SCM): COPR clones the repo and
# runs this spec; `cargo build` fetches crates over the network (COPR allows it).
#
# DEPENDENCIES NOT IN BASE FEDORA:
#   * ffmpeg / ffmpeg-libs with NVENC — from RPM Fusion *nonfree*. Enable it in
#     the COPR project (External Repositories) and on the target host.
#   * The NVIDIA driver (libnvidia-encode / libEGL_nvidia) — present on Bazzite's
#     -nvidia images; on plain Fedora install akmod-nvidia + xorg-x11-drv-nvidia-cuda.
#
# Bazzite already ships gamescope, PipeWire and the NVIDIA stack, so on Bazzite the
# only new runtime bits are ffmpeg-libs (RPM Fusion) + opus + libei.

# slipstream-host is Linux-only and links system FFmpeg/PipeWire/Opus. The HOST is x86_64 only —
# its encode stack is NVENC/QSV/AMF — but the CLIENT builds and runs fine on aarch64, so the spec
# accepts both arches and `--without host` (below) selects the client-only build.
ExclusiveArch:  x86_64 aarch64

# The zerocopy FFI links the NVIDIA driver's libcuda.so.1; rpm's auto-dep generator would turn
# that into a hard Requires on libcuda.so.1 (and we never want to pin the driver — NVENC/EGL come
# from whatever NVIDIA stack the host runs, expressed below as the weak xorg-x11-drv-nvidia-cuda
# Recommends). Drop it from the auto-Requires, mirroring the Debian package's NVIDIA filter.
%global __requires_exclude ^libcuda\\.so.*$

# Management web console subpackage (slipstream-web). OFF by default: building the Nitro SSR bundle
# (and running it) needs `bun`, which a plain rpmbuild / COPR mock chroot does NOT have. CI's builder
# image (ci/fedora-rpm.Dockerfile) DOES have bun and builds with `--with web`, so the GitHub RPM
# registry carries slipstream-web. COPR (no bun) builds host+client only — use the GitHub registry for
# the console, or enable bun + `--with web` in the COPR project. Mirrors the Debian slipstream-web .deb.
%bcond_with web

# Plugin/script runner subpackage (slipstream-scripting). OFF by default for the same reason as web:
# building the bun bundle needs `bun`, absent from a plain rpmbuild / COPR mock chroot. CI's builder
# image has bun and builds with `--with scripting`, so the GitHub RPM registry carries it. Mirrors the
# Debian slipstream-scripting .deb.
%bcond_with scripting

# The HOST half of this spec (the slipstream package itself + the tray). ON by default, so an
# ordinary x86_64 build is unchanged. `--without host` drops the host binary, the tray, the
# headless-session data, the firewalld services and the main %%files section entirely, leaving
# only slipstream-client — which is what an aarch64 build produces, since the host's encode stack
# (NVENC/QSV/AMF) is x86 and the client's is not. Omitting the main %%files is what stops rpm
# from emitting an empty `slipstream` package alongside the client.

Requires:       pipewire

# The host captures the sink monitor through NATIVE PipeWire (audio/linux.rs) and never opens a

# API. Weak-dep, because `pipewire-pulseaudio` CONFLICTS with `pulseaudio`: as a hard Requires it
# made the host uninstallable for anyone running real PulseAudio, which serves those games just
# as well. Fedora installs pipewire-pulseaudio by default, so the default box is unaffected.
Recommends:     pipewire-pulseaudio
Requires:       opus
Requires:       libei
# FFmpeg runtime with NVENC (RPM Fusion). Weak-dep so the package installs even if
# the user hasn't enabled RPM Fusion yet, but it WILL fail to encode without it.
Recommends:     ffmpeg-libs
# A compositor to drive. Bazzite ships gamescope; the others are user choice.
Recommends:     gamescope
Suggests:       kwin

# VAAPI encode drivers for AMD (radeonsi) / Intel (iHD) — the auto-selected VAAPI backend on a
# non-NVIDIA GPU. NOTE: Fedora's stock mesa-va-drivers has HEVC/AV1 *disabled* (patents); full

Recommends:     mesa-va-drivers
Recommends:     intel-media-driver
# The management web console (pairing + status) every user needs — a separate noarch subpackage.
# Weak-dep so `dnf install slipstream` pulls it where it exists (the GitHub registry); harmless where
# it doesn't (a COPR build without `--with web` simply has no slipstream-web to satisfy).
Recommends:     slipstream-web
# The plugin/script runner (host automation on bun). Same weak-dep story: pulled where it exists,
# harmless where a `--with scripting`-less build didn't produce it. Its systemd --user unit ships
# disabled — the runner is inert until you add scripts/plugins.

%description
slipstream is a Linux-first, low-latency desktop and game streaming host. It speaks
the Moonlight/GameStream protocol (pair a stock Moonlight client) and its own native
slipstream/1 protocol (GF(2^16) Leopard FEC + AES-GCM, mid-stream mode renegotiation,
client microphone passthrough). Each session gets a virtual output at the client's
exact resolution and refresh via a per-compositor backend (KWin, gamescope, Mutter,
Sway/wlroots), captured zero-copy (dmabuf -> CUDA -> NVENC) and split-encoded above
~1 Gpix/s. Input (mouse/keyboard/gamepads) is injected back into the session.

%package client
Summary:        Low-latency desktop/game streaming client (slipstream/1, GTK4)
# Audio playback / mic capture want the PipeWire daemon; degrade gracefully without it.
Recommends:     pipewire
Recommends:     wireplumber
# The session streamer loads libvulkan at runtime (ash) for its ash/Skia presenter + Vulkan
# Video decode. vulkan-loader provides libvulkan.so.1; the ICD is the GPU's mesa/NVIDIA driver.
Requires:       vulkan-loader

%description client
The native Linux client for slipstream. Discovers hosts on the LAN (mDNS), trusts
them via certificate pinning with a SPAKE2 PIN pairing ceremony, and streams HEVC
video (GF(2^16) Leopard FEC + AES-GCM over UDP, QUIC control plane) with Opus
audio, microphone passthrough, and full gamepad support including DualSense
touchpad, motion, adaptive triggers and lightbar through SDL3. The host creates a
virtual output at exactly this client's resolution and refresh rate — no scaling.

%if %{with web}
%package web
Summary:        slipstream management web console (Nitro SSR on bun + React)
# Runtime is BUN (the console uses Nitro's `bun` preset + a Bun.serve TLS entry — node can't
# run it). Bun isn't in Fedora repos, so we VENDOR a bun binary into the package, which makes this
# subpackage arch-specific (it can no longer be noarch). No system nodejs/bun dependency.

%description web
The browser console for a slipstream streaming host: status, paired devices, and the SPAKE2
PIN pairing flow every client needs. Runs as a systemd --user service on port 3000 over HTTPS
(HTTP/1.1 over TLS, with the host's own identity cert), login-gated (a password generated on first
start), proxying the host's loopback HTTPS management API with a bearer token injected server-side
(never sent to the browser). Auto-wired to the host on a packaged install — it sources the host's
mgmt token, identity cert, and a generated login password, no env editing. Bundles its own bun
runtime. Enable with `systemctl --user enable --now slipstream-web`.
%endif

%if %{with scripting}
%package scripting
Summary:        slipstream plugin/script runner (Effect SDK on bun)
# Runtime is BUN — the runner import()s the operator's .ts plugin files, which only bun can do. bun
# isn't in Fedora repos, so we VENDOR it into the package (arch-specific, not noarch). The runner
# itself is bundled to ONE self-contained JS (effect + SDK inlined), so no node_modules ship.

%description scripting
The plugin/script runner for a slipstream streaming host: it discovers loose scripts under
~/.config/slipstream/scripts and installed slipstream-plugin-* packages under ~/.config/slipstream/
plugins, and supervises each as an Effect fiber (capped-jittered restart; SIGTERM shuts the whole
tree down structurally so plugin finalizers run). A plugin auto-wires to the host's mgmt token +
identity cert on the same box — no env editing. Bundles its own bun runtime. OPT-IN: the systemd
--user unit ships disabled (the runner is inert until you add scripts/plugins). Enable with
`systemctl --user enable --now slipstream-scripting`.

# --features slipstream-host/vulkan-encode: the AMD/Intel twin — a raw VK_KHR_video_encode_h265 backend
# with real RFI (clean P-frame recovery anchor via DPB reference slots; design/linux-vulkan-video-encode.md).
# Pure Rust `ash` (no new lib / no link-time dep); default on for HEVC (SLIPSTREAM_VULKAN_ENCODE=0 opts
