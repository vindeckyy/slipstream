# Wrap a built slipstream pacman package into a systemd-sysext image — the update-survivable way to
# add it to an immutable Arch-derived distro (SteamOS 3): the .raw overlays /usr read-only from the
# writable /var/lib/extensions/, so it persists across A/B OS updates with no `steamos-readonly
# disable`. Works for either split package — on a Steam Deck you'd wrap the CLIENT. Needs
# `bsdtar`/`tar`, `squashfs-tools` (mksquashfs).
#
# Usage:  bash build-sysext.sh [--gamescope <slipstream-gamescope-*.pkg.tar.zst>] \
#                              <slipstream-{host,client}-*.pkg.tar.zst>
# Output: <pkgname>.raw   (e.g. slipstream-client.raw)
#
# --gamescope folds the HDR-capable gamescope companion package (packaging/gamescope) into a HOST
# image as /usr/bin/slipstream-gamescope — what lets the gamescope backend stream 10-bit BT.2020 PQ
# instead of 8-bit SDR (the host prefers that name on PATH and attempts HDR by default). Mirrors
# the Bazzite image's fold-in, including the honesty check: the binary is verified by executing
# its `+pfhdr` banner, never trusted by filename. Omit it and the image is exactly what it was —
# the host then stays SDR on that backend, by design. (No CAP_SYS_NICE inside the image: file
# capabilities don't survive this squashfs path — gamescope runs without it, pacing slightly
# worse, same as the Bazzite sysext.)
