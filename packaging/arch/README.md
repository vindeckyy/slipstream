# slipstream on Arch Linux / SteamOS

Packaging for slipstream on Arch and Arch-derived immutable distros. The `PKGBUILD` is a **split
package** producing **`slipstream-host`** (the gaming-rig host) and **`slipstream-client`** (the native
GTK4/libadwaita Linux client) — mirrors the rpm subpackages (`packaging/rpm/slipstream.spec`) and the
deb build scripts. On a **Steam Deck used as a client you want `slipstream-client`** (it's what the
[Decky plugin](../../clients/decky/) launches); on a gaming rig, `slipstream-host`.

> **Steam Deck as a HOST:** don't use this PKGBUILD — SteamOS's read-only root makes `makepkg`/sysext
> awkward, and a prebuilt binary breaks on OS library bumps. Use the on-device build script instead:
> **[`scripts/steamdeck/install.sh`](../../scripts/steamdeck/)** (it builds in a Debian-trixie distrobox
> ABI-matched to SteamOS and uses **VAAPI** on the Deck's AMD GPU). The Deck host path is the one
> exception to "host encode is NVENC-only" below.

A third member, **`slipstream-web`** (the browser management console — pairing + status), is
**opt-in**: build it by setting `PF_WITH_WEB=1`, which requires **`bun`** at build time (`bun-bin`
from the AUR if it isn't in your repos). bun is also the **runtime** — the console serves HTTPS
(HTTP/1.1 over TLS) via `Bun.serve`, so the package vendors the bun binary (no `nodejs` dependency). A
default `makepkg` builds only host+client with no JS tooling — mirroring the RPM spec's `%bcond_with web`.

> **Host encode: NVENC on NVIDIA, VAAPI on AMD/Intel** (`SLIPSTREAM_ENCODER=auto` picks one). The host
> now has a VAAPI encoder + zero-copy dmabuf path alongside NVENC/CUDA, so `slipstream-host` works on
> Arch + NVIDIA **and** AMD/Intel (incl. the Steam Deck — see the on-device path above). The client
> decodes via VAAPI on AMD/Intel with a software fallback.

## Install (build locally)

There is no public pacman binary repo. Build with the PKGBUILD in the next section, or install
packages from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/vindeckyy/slipstream/releases) when attached.
If you publish your own pacman feed, keep stable and canary separate (see
[Release Channels](../../docs-site/content/docs/channels.md)).

Then the same first-run steps as a source build (printed by the install scriptlet): `input`
group, `host.env`, `systemctl --user enable --now slipstream-host` — see the next section.

## Build from source — Arch Linux (mutable)

```sh
cd packaging/arch
# Build the working tree (CI / dev) — no git fetch:
PF_SRCDIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)" makepkg -f --holdver
# …or build the tagged release the AUR way:
makepkg -si
# …add the web console too (needs bun / bun-bin):
PF_WITH_WEB=1 PF_SRCDIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)" makepkg -f --holdver
```

### aarch64 (Arch Linux ARM) — the client

The PKGBUILD declares `arch=('x86_64' 'aarch64')`. On aarch64 it builds the **client only** —
`pkgname` drops `slipstream-host`, so makepkg never enters the host's build or package path, and
`build()` skips the host/tray cargo invocations and their NVENC/Vulkan-encode features. The host
stays x86-only because its encode stack (NVENC/QSV/AMF) is.

Nothing else changes — run the same command on an Arch Linux ARM box:

```sh
cd packaging/arch
PF_SRCDIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)" makepkg -f --holdver
# -> slipstream-client-<ver>-<rel>-aarch64.pkg.tar.zst   (no slipstream-host package)
```

There is no cross-compile path here: makepkg builds for `CARCH`, so this wants a real aarch64
Arch machine (or an emulated Arch Linux ARM container, which is slow). Unlike the deb, it has
**not** been verified end to end yet — there is no official arm64 Arch container to test in.
Then the standard first-run (printed by the install scriptlet):
```sh
sudo usermod -aG input "$USER"          # virtual gamepads; re-login after
mkdir -p ~/.config/slipstream
cp /usr/share/slipstream/host.env.bazzite ~/.config/slipstream/host.env   # gamescope backend
systemctl --user enable --now slipstream-host
# Web console (if you installed the slipstream-web package): enable it, then choose a password in
# the browser on first visit.
systemctl --user enable --now slipstream-web
# open https://<host-ip>:47992
```
NVENC/EGL come from the NVIDIA driver: `sudo pacman -S --needed nvidia-utils`. Arch's stock
`ffmpeg` already has NVENC built in — no RPM-Fusion-style swap needed (unlike Fedora).

### Runtime dependency map (Fedora/Debian → Arch)

| Need | Arch package |
|------|--------------|
| FFmpeg + NVENC | `ffmpeg` (NVENC built in) |
| PipeWire + session mgr | `pipewire` `wireplumber` |
| PulseAudio-API audio for games | `pipewire-pulse` *(host optdepend — real `pulseaudio` also works; never a hard dep, it CONFLICTS with `pulseaudio`)* |
| Opus / input injection | `opus` `libei` |
| GL/EGL + gbm + xkb + wayland | `libglvnd` `mesa` `libxkbcommon` `wayland` |
| NVIDIA driver (NVENC/EGL/CUDA) | `nvidia-utils` *(optdepend — never a hard dep)* |
| Compositor backends | `gamescope` (≥3.16.22) / `kwin` / `mutter` / `sway` *(optdepends)* |

## Immutable Arch (SteamOS 3) — the systemd-sysext mechanism

SteamOS has a **read-only `/usr` on A/B partitions**, and every OS update reimages the rootfs —
so `steamos-readonly disable` + `pacman` is fragile for anything that must survive updates. The
SteamOS-blessed overlay mechanism is a **systemd-sysext**: an image merged read-only over `/usr`
at boot, living in the writable `/var/lib/extensions/`.

> **For a SteamOS HOST this is NOT the supported path** — that is
> [`scripts/steamdeck/install.sh`](../../scripts/steamdeck/) (the on-device distrobox build,
> which also builds the HDR gamescope). A host sysext carries a prebuilt binary that breaks on
> the next SteamOS soname bump, and `/var` — where sysexts live — is per-A/B-partition-set.
> The mechanism below is what the Deck **client** image uses (next section), and an option for
> operators on other immutable Arch derivatives who accept the prebuilt trade-off.

Build the package, then wrap its `/usr` payload into a sysext image:
```sh
# 1. build the pacman packages (needs an Arch environment / container)
cd packaging/arch && PF_SRCDIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)" makepkg -f --holdver
( cd ../gamescope && makepkg -f -d --holdver )   # optional: the HDR gamescope companion
# 2. turn it into a sysext .raw (extracts the packages' /usr into an image + extension-release);
#    --gamescope folds the HDR build into a HOST image (verified by its +pfhdr banner)
bash build-sysext.sh --gamescope ../gamescope/slipstream-gamescope-*.pkg.tar.zst slipstream-host-*.pkg.tar.zst
# 3. on the box:
sudo cp slipstream-host.raw /var/lib/extensions/
sudo systemctl enable --now systemd-sysext      # merges it
systemctl --user enable --now slipstream-host     # the user unit is now under /usr/lib
```
The udev rule, sysctl, and systemd **user** unit all live under `/usr/lib`, so the merged sysext
exposes them. `systemd-sysext refresh` re-merges after a reboot. (One HDR nuance of the sysext
path: file capabilities don't survive it, so gamescope runs without `CAP_SYS_NICE` — everything
works, frame pacing is marginally worse than the pacman install, whose `.install` sets the cap.)

## Steam Deck — the client (what the Decky plugin launches)

To stream *to* a Deck, you install **`slipstream-client`** there — same sysext mechanism, but
wrapping the client package instead. The split `makepkg` produces both `.pkg.tar.zst` files; on the
Deck use the client one:
```sh
cd packaging/arch && PF_SRCDIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)" makepkg -f --holdver
bash build-sysext.sh slipstream-client-*.pkg.tar.zst        # → slipstream-client.raw
# on the Deck:
sudo cp slipstream-client.raw /var/lib/extensions/
sudo systemctl enable --now systemd-sysext
sudo pacman -S --needed libva-mesa-driver                  # VAAPI hw decode on the Deck's AMD APU
```
Now `slipstream-client` is on `PATH`, so the **[Decky plugin](../../clients/decky/)** finds and
launches it (`slipstream-client --connect host:port`) — gamescope composites its video like a game.
The client needs no `/dev/uinput` or compositor-spawning rights (it captures input and decodes),
so it's a much lighter sysext than the host.

## Firewall

**Stock Arch ships no firewall** — every port is open by default, so there is nothing to do.
Spins that enable one **do not** get their ports opened for you: an Arch package never touches the
admin's running firewall. **CachyOS is the common case** — it ships `ufw` enabled by default (not
firewalld), so out of the box the host is unreachable until you allow it. Some other spins (e.g.
EndeavourOS) enable `firewalld` instead.

The `slipstream-host` package ships openers for **both** — a ufw application profile
(`/etc/ufw/applications.d/slipstream`) and firewalld service definitions
(`/usr/lib/firewalld/services/`) — so enabling is one command whichever you run:

```sh
# ufw (CachyOS, and Ubuntu once you enable ufw) — reads the profile at once, no reload needed:
sudo ufw allow slipstream-native        # the native-only host (the default)
sudo ufw allow slipstream-gamestream    # …or add this for the Moonlight/GameStream host

# firewalld (EndeavourOS and other Fedora-like spins):
sudo firewall-cmd --reload                                        # pick up the installed def
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=slipstream-native
#                              --add-service=slipstream-gamestream  # …for the Moonlight host
sudo firewall-cmd --reload
```

`slipstream-gamestream` opens the fixed Moonlight ports + mDNS; `slipstream-native` opens the QUIC
control port (UDP 9777) + mDNS + the mgmt/library API (TCP 47990, HTTPS + mTLS). Enable both if the
host runs `serve --gamestream` (which serves both planes). The **data plane is an *ephemeral* UDP port** the client opens with a hole-punch, so
there is no fixed data port in either service — the host streams back out through the path the
client opened, which any firewall that allows outbound UDP (the default) passes. The mgmt REST API
(TCP 47990, HTTPS + mTLS) binds all interfaces by default so paired clients can browse the game library
— the `slipstream-native` profile opens it. Off-loopback it serves only read-only status/library to a
paired client cert and keeps the admin surface loopback-only (`--mgmt-bind 127.0.0.1:47990` to opt out).

If you installed the **web console** (`slipstream-web`) and want it reachable from another device,
open its port with the matching one-liner — `sudo ufw allow slipstream-web` or `sudo firewall-cmd
--permanent --add-service=slipstream-web && sudo firewall-cmd --reload` — which opens **TCP 47992**
(HTTPS, login-gated). The mgmt API (47990) is opened for paired clients by the `slipstream-native`
profile (game-library browsing over mTLS); off-loopback it serves only read-only status/library and
keeps admin loopback-only.

Prefer explicit rules (or a firewall the shipped profiles don't cover)? Open the ports directly.
The **native `slipstream/1`** plane:

- **QUIC control plane: UDP 9777** (`serve --native-port N` to change).
- **Data plane: a separate UDP port.** By default it's *random* — the host binds `0.0.0.0:0` and
  tells the client which port it got. Video flows host → client, but the **client sends the first
  packet** (a hole-punch), so the host learns the client's real source and streams back — this
  traverses NAT / inter-VLAN with no forwarded port. **You normally don't open it:** if a deny-inbound
  firewall drops the punch, the host waits ~2.5 s and falls back to the client-reported address, and a
  stateful firewall then admits the return (it just adds ~2.5 s to session start). To skip that delay,
  pin it with **`serve --data-port <PORT>`** (or `SLIPSTREAM_DATA_PORT`): the host binds that fixed
  port and streams direct (no punch-wait) — open exactly that one port. A fixed port serves one
  session at a time (concurrent ones fall back to random + hole-punch), and direct mode needs the
  client's reported address to be reachable (flat LAN / a non-remapping port-forward).

And the **GameStream / Moonlight** ports (fixed) — only needed if you run the host with
`serve --gamestream` (opt-in, trusted LAN only); bare `serve` is native-only and doesn't open these:

| Port | Proto | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| 47984 | TCP | HTTPS nvhttp (paired, mutual-TLS) |
| 47989 | TCP | HTTP nvhttp (`/serverinfo`, `/pair` PIN flow) |
| 48010 | TCP | RTSP handshake |
| 47998–48010 | UDP | Video RTP (+ FEC), ENet control (47999), audio (48000) |
| 5353 | UDP | mDNS auto-discovery |

The mgmt API (TCP 47990, HTTPS + mTLS) binds all interfaces by default so paired clients can browse the
game library — the `slipstream-native` profile opens it. Off-loopback it serves only read-only
status/library to a paired client cert; the admin surface stays loopback-only. Pass
`--mgmt-bind 127.0.0.1:47990` to keep it loopback-only (then leave 47990 closed).

With `ufw` (explicit ports, instead of the shipped `slipstream-native`/`slipstream-gamestream` profile):

```sh
sudo ufw allow 9777/udp                                 # slipstream/1 control plane
sudo ufw allow 47990/tcp                                # mgmt/library API (HTTPS + mTLS; LAN = read-only, paired)
sudo ufw allow 47984/tcp && sudo ufw allow 47989/tcp && sudo ufw allow 48010/tcp
sudo ufw allow 47998,47999,48000/udp                    # GameStream video/control/audio
sudo ufw allow 5353/udp                                 # mDNS discovery
# The slipstream/1 data plane uses a random UDP port; leave it closed on a LAN — the host hole-punches
# and falls back (~2.5s at session start if firewalled). To skip that, pin it: `serve --data-port
# 9778` and `ufw allow 9778/udp`.
```

With raw `nftables` (add to your `inet filter input` chain):

```
udp dport 9777 accept                  # slipstream/1 control plane
tcp dport 47990 accept                 # mgmt/library API (HTTPS + mTLS; LAN = read-only, paired)
tcp dport { 47984, 47989, 48010 } accept
udp dport { 47998-48000, 5353 } accept # GameStream video/control/audio + mDNS
# The slipstream/1 data plane is a random UDP port — normally left closed (hole-punch + ~2.5s
# fallback). Pin it with `serve --data-port <PORT>` to open exactly one instead.
```

## Files
- `PKGBUILD` — split package: `slipstream-host` + `slipstream-client` (builds the working tree via
  `PF_SRCDIR`, or a git tag for AUR).
- `slipstream-host.install` / `slipstream-client.install` — pacman scriptlets (udev reload + sysctl +
  first-run hint, incl. the ufw/firewalld enable command for whichever is present), mirror the RPM
  `%post` / deb postinst.
- The firewall openers are shared across all Linux packaging and live in [`../linux/`](../linux/):
  the ufw application profile (`slipstream.ufw` → `/etc/ufw/applications.d/slipstream`) and the
  firewalld service definitions (`slipstream-native.xml` / `slipstream-gamestream.xml` /
  `slipstream-web.xml` → `/usr/lib/firewalld/services/`). None auto-enabled; see Firewall above.
- `build-sysext.sh` — wraps either built `.pkg.tar.zst` into a `systemd-sysext` `.raw` for SteamOS
  (derives the name from the package, so it works for host or client).
