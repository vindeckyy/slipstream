.SYNOPSIS
  Generate the stable slipstream driver code-signing certificate.

.DESCRIPTION
  Produces a self-signed code-signing cert (CN=slipstream-driver) and writes the two values that
  become the DRIVER_CERT_PFX_B64 / DRIVER_CERT_PASSWORD GitHub Actions secrets.

  Built on the .NET CertificateRequest API rather than New-SelfSignedCertificate, for two reasons:
    * No key container is involved, so this works over SSH. New-SelfSignedCertificate fails with
      NTE_PERM 0x80090010 on a network logon because it wants the user's key container.
    * The extension set is explicit, so it matches byte-for-byte what the drivers have always been
      signed with (verified against the certs on this box): KeyUsage=DigitalSignature (critical),
      EKU=codeSigning (non-critical), SubjectKeyIdentifier, and NO basicConstraints.

  The key exists only in memory and in the .pfx this writes. It is never added to a certificate
  store, so there is nothing to clean up afterwards except the output folder.

  Self-test: the generated .pfx is used to actually sign a scratch binary with signtool before
  anything is reported, so a cert signtool cannot consume fails HERE and not six months from now
  in a release build.

.PARAMETER OutDir
  Where to write the outputs. Defaults to a fresh timestamped folder under the user profile.

.PARAMETER TestOnly
  Generate, self-test, then delete everything and report. Writes no secrets. Use to verify the
  script works before generating the real key.

  pwsh -File make-driver-cert.ps1
