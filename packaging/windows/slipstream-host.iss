; slipstream host installer (Inno Setup 6).
;
; Produces a signed setup.exe that lays the host into Program Files, optionally installs the bundled
; ss-vdisplay virtual-display driver, and DELEGATES service registration to `slipstream-host service
; install`. The real, idempotent install logic (SCM registration, firewall rules, default host.env,
; the SYSTEM->interactive-session CreateProcessAsUserW supervisor for secure-desktop capture) lives in
; crates/slipstream-host/src/service.rs - this script does NOT duplicate it. That SYSTEM service model
; is exactly why MSIX is unusable here and we ship a classic elevated installer instead.
;
; Built by pack-host-installer.ps1, e.g.:
;   ISCC.exe /DMyAppVersion=0.2.123 /DBinDir=C:\t\release /DStageDir=C:\t\out\stage \
;            /DOutputDir=C:\t\out packaging\windows\slipstream-host.iss
; Omit /DStageDir to build an installer WITHOUT the bundled driver (driver becomes a prerequisite).

{ Captured in InitializeSetup - BEFORE [Run] calls `service install`, which creates host.env. True on

  GamestreamParam): a silent run has no wizard on screen, so every task checkbox falls back to its
  script default. Re-applying those defaults on an upgrade would overwrite a setting the user chose
  on an earlier run, with nothing shown. `winget upgrade` runs us exactly that way. }

  DELIBERATELY NARROWER than it was. The old probe also counted the service key existing at ANY
  start type, plus a bare Program Files\<Name> directory - so a disabled service, or a leftover folder
  from an uninstall, read as a live conflict. Combined with the silent-install default of IDNO that
  aborted setup, and a field report followed within hours of 0.20.0: `winget install
  vindeckyy.SlipstreamHost` failed with exit code 1 (0x8A150006) on a box whose Sunshine was not running.

  alarm) - the two surfaces now agree.

  A host running as a plain user process rather than a service is not detected here, by choice:
  that cannot be seen from pure Pascal, it is a runtime condition rather than an install-time one,

  "keep host.env as-is" (windows/service.rs: "None = flag absent, keep host.env as-is"). Passing an
  explicit on/off would rewrite SLIPSTREAM_HOST_CMD whenever it still holds either canonical value -
  so a user who chose GameStream ON, then upgraded with the task unchecked (which is what EVERY

  FRESH INSTALL ONLY, for the same reason as GamestreamParam: on an upgrade the flag is omitted and
  both `service install` and `web setup` resolve the scope from the marker the previous install
  recorded. Re-applying the task default would re-scope the firewall on every upgrade - and since
  this task is default-UNCHECKED, a silent upgrade would silently REVOKE a Public opt-in the user
  made once. The explicit =on/=off form is used so a fresh install still states its choice. }
