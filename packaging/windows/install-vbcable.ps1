.SYNOPSIS
  Silently install the bundled VB-Audio Virtual Cable (the slipstream virtual microphone) on the host.

.DESCRIPTION
  slipstream pipes the streaming client's microphone into a virtual audio cable's render endpoint; the
  cable's capture endpoint ("CABLE Output") then surfaces as a host microphone that games/apps record
  from (see crates/slipstream-host/src/audio/windows/wasapi_mic.rs). On a headless host there is no real
  audio output, so a virtual cable is required. We bundle the OFFICIAL base VB-CABLE package (VB-Audio,
  https://vb-cable.com) and install it unattended:

    1. If a "CABLE Input"/"CABLE Output" endpoint already exists, do nothing (idempotent).
    2. Pre-seed VB-Audio's Authenticode signing certificate (read from the bundled signed driver) into
       LocalMachine\TrustedPublisher, so the kernel-driver-publisher prompt is suppressed and the
       install is fully silent (required for the SYSTEM/Session-0 service install).
    3. Run the official silent installer: VBCABLE_Setup_x64.exe -i -h  (arm64: the same exe name in the
       arm64 package; x86 falls back to VBCABLE_Setup.exe).
    4. Wait briefly for the audio subsystem to register the new endpoint.

  VB-CABLE is donationware by VB-Audio Software, redistributed here under VB-Audio's bundling grant
  (https://vb-audio.com/Services/licensing.htm); see {app}\licenses\VB-CABLE-NOTICE.txt. Only the base
  single cable is bundled (A+B / C+D are not redistributable).

  Best-effort: any failure is logged and returns a non-zero exit, but the caller (the installer) treats
  it as non-fatal — the host still runs (mic passthrough then needs a manually-installed cable, and the
  host falls back to auto-installing the Steam Streaming pair).
