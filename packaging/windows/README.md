# Windows host packaging — signed Inno Setup installer

A one-file, signed `setup.exe` for the slipstream streaming **host** on Windows, published to GitHub's
generic package registry (`slipstream-host-windows`) by `.github/workflows/windows-host.yml`.

> Full picture (drivers-from-source, toolchain, CI, dev loop): **[`design/windows-build-and-packaging.md`](../../design/windows-build-and-packaging.md)**. This README is the `packaging/windows/` file index.

## x64 only (no ARM64)

Unlike the client (which ships x64 + ARM64 MSIX), the host is **x64-only by design**. It is coupled to
an NVIDIA GPU (NVENC, via `nvEncodeAPI64.dll` from the driver) and the **pf-vdisplay** virtual-display
driver — neither exists on Windows ARM64 (no ARM64 NVIDIA driver; the driver builds x64-only). An
ARM64 host would install but couldn't encode or create a virtual display, so we don't build one.
Revisit if NVIDIA-ARM Windows PCs ever ship.

## Why not MSIX (like the client)

The host installs a **`LocalSystem` SCM service** that `CreateProcessAsUserW`'s from Session 0 into the
interactive session for secure-desktop (UAC / lock screen) capture, adds firewall rules, and depends
on the **pf-vdisplay** UMDF/IDD virtual-display driver. MSIX's sandbox can install **neither** a SYSTEM
service of this kind **nor** a driver. So the host ships as a classic elevated installer.

The installer is deliberately thin: the real install logic — SCM registration, firewall rules, the
default `host.env`, and the SYSTEM→interactive-session supervisor — already lives in
`slipstream-host service install` (`crates/slipstream-host/src/service.rs`). The installer just lays the
exe into `C:\Program Files\slipstream\` and calls that subcommand, elevated.

## What the installer does

- Installs `slipstream-host.exe` (+ `host.env.example`, this README) to `{app}` (`C:\Program Files\slipstream`).
- **Optional task** *Install the pf-vdisplay virtual display driver* — imports the driver's self-signed
  cert (machine `Root` + `TrustedPublisher`), creates the `root\pf_vdisplay` device node (only
  if absent, via nefconc — never devgen — `install-pf-vdisplay.ps1`), and stages the driver with
  `pnputil /add-driver /install`.
  Best-effort: a driver failure warns but never aborts the install (the host degrades to a physical
  display without it).
- Runs `slipstream-host service install` (idempotent; writes a default `host.env` only if absent, so
  user config survives upgrades) and, by the *Start service now* task, `service start`.
- **Web management console** (bundled when packed with `-WebDir`/`-BunExe`, which the CI always is):
  lays down the built **self-contained** `.output` server (Nitro `noExternals` — deps bundled +
  tree-shaken, ~75 files, no `node_modules`) + a portable **bun**, prompts for a console login
  password (pre-filled with a secure random default, shown again on the final page; kept on upgrade),
  then `web-setup.ps1` writes the ACL'd `%ProgramData%\slipstream\web-password`, registers the
  **`SlipstreamWeb`** scheduled task (boot, SYSTEM, restart-on-failure → `web-run.cmd` → `bun` on
  `:3000`), opens TCP 3000, and starts it. It proxies the host's loopback mgmt API with the host's
  own `%ProgramData%\slipstream\mgmt-token`.
- **Upgrade:** stops a running `SlipstreamHost` service and waits for `STOPPED` before replacing files
  (otherwise the locked exe / respawning supervisor would block the copy), then re-points the service;
  the existing console password is kept (the wizard page is skipped).
- **Uninstall** (Add/Remove Programs): runs `service uninstall` (stop + delete service + remove
  firewall rules) and removes the `SlipstreamWeb` task + its firewall rule. The pf-vdisplay driver and the
  `%ProgramData%\slipstream` config (incl. `web-password`) are intentionally left in place.

Silent install: `slipstream-host-setup-<ver>.exe /VERYSILENT` (omit the driver with
`/MERGETASKS="!installdriver"`). A silent fresh install uses the generated random console password —
read it from `%ProgramData%\slipstream\web-password`.

## Prerequisites on the target box

- A **GPU for hardware encode**: an NVIDIA GPU + driver (NVENC), or an AMD/Intel GPU (AMF/QSV) — the
  exe is built `--features nvenc,amf-qsv`. Software H.264 is the GPU-less fallback.
- **Virtual gamepads need no prerequisite.** The DualSense / DualShock 4 / Xbox 360 (XUSB) UMDF drivers
  are **bundled** in the installer (the *Install the virtual gamepad drivers* task) and
  `pnputil`-installed. **ViGEmBus is no longer used.**

| `reset-pf-vdisplay.ps1` | **Dev:** recover a wedged driver — stop host → reap ghost monitor nodes → reload the adapter → start host (no reboot). See *Dev iteration* below. |
| `redeploy-pf-vdisplay.ps1` | **Dev:** one-shot redeploy — (optional) build → stop host → `deploy-dev.ps1 -Install` → reload adapter → start host. |
| `nvenc/nvenc.def`, `nvenc/gen-nvenc-importlib.ps1` | Synthesise `nvencodeapi.lib` for the `--features nvenc` link (llvm-dlltool / lib.exe). |
| `pf-vkhdr-layer/` | **HDR Vulkan layer** (standalone `cdylib`): lets Vulkan games (Doom: The Dark Ages, etc.) enable HDR over the virtual display by advertising the HDR surface formats the NVIDIA/AMD ICDs hide on an indirect display. Built by the packer, laid into `{app}\vklayer`, registered under `HKLM64\…\Khronos\Vulkan\ImplicitLayers` (opt-out *Install the HDR Vulkan layer* task). Self-gated on the display's HDR state. See its README. |

## Dev iteration on the test box (driver)

Two helpers wrap the painful manual steps of iterating on the pf-vdisplay driver against a live host
service. Run **elevated**; both default to the `SlipstreamHost` service.

```powershell
# Recover a WEDGED driver. Symptom: every session fails with
#   create virtual output: pf-vdisplay ADD ...: DeviceIoControl(0x222400): Element nicht gefunden (0x80070490)
# i.e. ERROR_NOT_FOUND — sustained ADD/REMOVE churn exhausted the IddCx monitor slots (ghost
# "Generic Monitor (slipstream)" nodes pile up, target_ids climb). A host restart's CLEAR_ALL does NOT
# fix it; the driver instance must be reloaded. This clears the ghosts + cycles the adapter (no reboot —
# this box boots to Proxmox).
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File reset-pf-vdisplay.ps1 -Verify -Probe C:\t-goal1\debug\slipstream-probe.exe

# Redeploy a driver build cleanly (stop host → install with a strictly-increasing DriverVer → reload
# adapter → start host). -Build runs `cargo build` first, but ONLY from an MSVC dev shell
# (LIBCLANG_PATH + Version_Number=10.0.26100.0); otherwise build separately and omit -Build.
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File redeploy-pf-vdisplay.ps1 -Build -Verify -Probe C:\t-goal1\debug\slipstream-probe.exe
```

The driver should reclaim monitor slots on REMOVE so churn can't wedge it; until it does, `reset` is
the recovery. From a Linux box drive either over SSH, e.g.
`ssh user@box 'powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File C:\...\reset-pf-vdisplay.ps1'`.

## Build locally (Windows, MSVC + Windows SDK + Inno Setup)

```powershell
# 1. import lib for the nvenc link
pwsh -File packaging\windows\nvenc\gen-nvenc-importlib.ps1 -OutDir C:\t\nvenc
$env:SLIPSTREAM_NVENC_LIB_DIR = 'C:\t\nvenc'

# 2. build the host
cargo build --release -p slipstream-host --features nvenc

# 3. pack (self-signed unless MSIX_CERT_PFX_B64/MSIX_CERT_PASSWORD are set; -NoDriver to skip pf-vdisplay)
pwsh -File packaging\windows\pack-host-installer.ps1 -Version 0.0.0-dev -TargetDir C:\t\release -OutDir C:\t\out
```

## Release

Push a `vX.Y.Z` tag — one tag releases every platform (see
[Release Channels](https://slipstream.unom.io/docs/channels)). The workflow builds, signs, and
publishes `slipstream-host-setup-X.Y.Z.exe` + the public `.cer`, refreshes the stable `latest/`
alias, and attaches the installer to the unified GitHub Release. Main pushes publish rolling
`0.3.<run>` **canary** builds to the `canary/` alias.
