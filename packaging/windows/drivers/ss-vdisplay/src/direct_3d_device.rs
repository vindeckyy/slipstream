//! The render-side D3D11 device the swap-chain processor binds to the IddCx swap-chain (STEP 5).
//!
//! Ported verbatim from the proven oracle (`packaging/windows/vdisplay-driver/ss-vdisplay/src/
//! direct_3d_device.rs` + the `DEVICE_POOL`/`pooled_device` that lived in its `context.rs`). The
//! D3D/DXGI types are the `windows` crate (refcounted COM, no manual Drop); the swap-chain/LUID hand-off
//! to the wdk-sys IddCx world happens via raw pointers in `swap_chain_processor.rs`.
//!
//! STEP 5 binds this device to the swap-chain to keep the monitor a live display; STEP 6 reuses the
//! device's immediate context in the frame publisher's `CopyResource` on each swap-chain processor
//! thread. The device is POOLED across processors (one per render LUID, [`pooled_device`]), so with
//! two live monitors two worker threads share it concurrently — creation must NOT pass
//! `D3D11_CREATE_DEVICE_SINGLETHREADED` (that was sound only pre-pooling, device-per-processor), and
//! the immediate context is `SetMultithreadProtected` (it has no internal locking of its own).
