//! The swap-chain processor (STEP 5 + STEP 6): a worker thread that DRAINS the IddCx swap-chain (so the
//! virtual monitor stays a usable display) and PUBLISHES each acquired surface into the host-created
//! shared ring (the IDD-push path).
//!
//! The OS presents the composited desktop to the driver through a swap-chain; the driver MUST consume it
//! (acquire → finished-processing) or the monitor stalls. STEP 5 binds our render device to the swap-chain
//! (`IddCxSwapChainSetDevice`) and loops acquire/finish. STEP 6 lazily attaches a [`FramePublisher`] to
//! the host's shared ring and, on each acquired frame, `CopyResource`s `out.MetaData.pSurface` into the
//! next ring slot before finishing the frame (a non-IDD-push session simply never attaches and keeps
//! draining). Frames the ring can NOT take feed the [`FrameStash`] instead, which every fresh attach
//! republishes as its instant first frame — the first-frame guarantee that makes a session opened onto
//! an IDLE desktop show a picture without waiting for anything to dirty the display.
//!
//! Ported from the proven oracle (`packaging/windows/vdisplay-driver/ss-vdisplay/src/
//! swap_chain_processor.rs`) onto wdk-sys + wdk-iddcx. The oracle's `wdf_umdf`/`wdf_umdf_sys` are
//! replaced by `wdk_sys::iddcx::*` + the `wdk_iddcx` DDI wrappers. Those wrappers return a RAW
//! `NTSTATUS` (`i32`) that is HRESULT-shaped for the swap-chain DDIs, so we classify it by hand
//! (`hr >= 0` = success; `0x8000_000A` = E_PENDING; `hr < 0 && != E_PENDING` = error) rather than with
//! `nt_success`.
