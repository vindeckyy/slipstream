//! STEP 6 — IDD-push frame publisher (DRIVER side), attached over the **sealed channel**.
//!
//! The restricted WUDFHost token canNOT create named kernel objects — and since the frame channel
//! carries whole-desktop pixels, the objects are not merely host-created but **unnamed**: nothing to
//! enumerate, open by name, or pre-create ("squat"). The **host** creates the shared header +
//! frame-ready event + ring of keyed-mutex textures with no names, duplicates the handles INTO this
//! WUDFHost process (`DuplicateHandle` — SYSTEM can, we can't reciprocate, which is why the host is the
//! broker), and delivers the handle VALUES over `IOCTL_SET_FRAME_CHANNEL` ([`crate::control`] stashes
//! them per monitor as a [`FrameChannel`]). The swap-chain worker picks the stash up and attaches with
//! [`FramePublisher::from_channel`]. Only the two endpoint processes ever hold a handle to any frame
//! object — see `design/idd-push-security.md`.
//!
//! The driver writes its actual render-adapter LUID + a status code back into the host-created header
//! (our only driver-visibility channel: UMDF hides OutputDebugString in ETW and the token can't write
//! files), then copies each acquired swap-chain surface into the next ring slot and signals the host.
//!
//! Host counterpart: `crates/slipstream-host/src/capture/windows/idd_push.rs`. The shared `SharedHeader`
//! layout, the [`FrameToken`] packing, the `MAGIC`/`RING_LEN`, the `DRV_STATUS_*` codes and the
//! channel-delivery struct are NOT hand-duplicated here: both sides `use ss_driver_proto::{control,
//! frame}`, which OWNS the contract (with `const` size asserts so any drift is a compile error).
//!
//! This module also owns the [`FrameStash`] — the driver-retained copy of the most recent composed
//! frame that the swap-chain worker republishes into every freshly-attached ring, so a session
//! opening onto an IDLE desktop gets its first frame immediately instead of waiting for something
//! to dirty the display (the first-frame guarantee; see the type docs). Purely driver-internal
//! behavior — no proto change: the host just sees a normal `seq = 1` publish right after attach.
