//! ss-vdisplay — the all-Rust UMDF IddCx virtual-display driver (M1 step-2 rewrite, on wdk-sys + the
//! owned ss-driver-proto ABI). See design/windows-host-rewrite.md §14 for the full port plan.
//!
//! STEP 2: the IddCx driver SKELETON — DriverEntry → driver_add builds the full `IDD_CX_CLIENT_CONFIG`
//! (14 IddCx callbacks + the PnP `EvtDeviceD0Entry`, all stubs) sized via the versioned
//! [`size::idd_cx_client_config_size`], runs `IddCxDeviceInitConfig` → `WdfDeviceCreate` →
//! `WdfDeviceCreateDeviceInterface`(the owned ss-vdisplay GUID) → `IddCxDeviceInitialize`, and exports
//! `IddMinimumVersionRequired`. This links `IddCxStub` (the CI gate). The real adapter init (STEP 3),
//! control plane + monitor/modes (STEP 4), and swap-chain/IDD-push (STEP 5-6) fill the stubs in.

// fn-level `unsafe` never silently blesses the whole body, AND every `unsafe {}` must carry a `// SAFETY:`
// proof. An IddCx display driver is inherently FFI-bound (D3D11 / IddCx DDIs / cross-process shared
// textures), so it can't be unsafe-FREE the way the gamepad drivers now are (their logic moved onto the
// safe `ss_umdf_util` layer); these gates make it unsafe-AUDITED instead, and stop it regressing.
