/// dropped the arrival mode from the target list, breaking even a resize BACK to it); the update
/// therefore accumulates — new mode first, every previously-advertised mode kept (deduped by
/// resolution, capped at [`MODE_LIST_CAP`]) — and the real payoff is at the NEXT re-arrival,
/// where [`create_monitor`]'s same-id history union makes every previously-used mode settable.
///
/// The stored list is updated FIRST (under the lock) so any OS re-query through the mode DDIs
/// ([`modes_for_object`]/[`modes_for_id`]) sees the new list, and REVERTED if the DDI fails — the
