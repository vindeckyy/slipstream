// SAFETY: `&MappedView` IS shared across threads for real — `ChannelState::data()` hands out
// `&'static MappedView`, and every driver using it dispatches its queue
// `WdfIoQueueDispatchParallel` with `NumberOfPresentedRequests = u32::MAX`, so two callbacks can
// hold it at once. What makes that sound is NOT that the accessors are individually race-free:
// `read_u8`/`write_u8`/`read_u16`/… are plain unaligned accesses through `&self` and would race if
// two threads hit the same offset. It is that these bytes are a section mapped into ANOTHER PROCESS
// that writes them concurrently, so no Rust-level exclusivity over them is achievable in the first
// place — the peer defeats it regardless of what this type does. Consistency is therefore the
// channel protocol's job (seq-fenced publishes, per the struct doc), the cross-process
// synchronization fields go through the `load_*`/`store_*` ATOMIC accessors, and each side reads
// only fields the protocol says are stable.
//
// ⚠ The rule this proof implies, for anything added later: a new accessor may use the plain path
// ONLY for bytes the protocol already fences. Anything that must be coherent between threads or
// between processes belongs in the atomic set — a plain accessor over such a field is a race the
// `Sync` here does not cover.
