# Build a slipstream-host .deb for Ubuntu/Debian hosts.
#
# Mirrors the Fedora RPM (../rpm/slipstream.spec): the host binary + the uinput udev rule
# + the systemd *user* unit + headless session helpers + example config + the OpenAPI doc.
#
# Runtime Depends are computed by `dpkg-shlibdeps` from the binary's actual DT_NEEDED, NOT
# hand-listed: the binary pulls a large transitive lib closure (most of it via ffmpeg) and
# the exact soname package names (libavcodec62, libpipewire-0.3-0t64, …) drift across distro
# releases — shlibdeps tracks them automatically and pins them to whatever the BUILD distro
# ships. Build this inside the Ubuntu 26.04 rust-ci image so those names match the target
# boxes exactly. `--ignore-missing-info` drops libcuda.so.1 (the NVIDIA driver lib, linked via
# FFI): on a GPU-less builder it resolves to no package, and we must never hard-depend on a
# specific libnvidia-compute-<ver> anyway — NVENC/EGL come from the driver, out of band.
#
# BUNDLE_FFMPEG=1 (Ubuntu 24.04 LTS builds, ci/rust-ci-noble.Dockerfile): instead of hard-depending
# on the distro's libav* — which don't exist on 24.04 (it ships FFmpeg 6.1 / libavcodec60, the host
# needs 8 / libavcodec62) — copy a from-source FFmpeg into /usr/lib/slipstream-host, repoint the
# binary's rpath there, and drop the libav*/libsw*/libpostproc sonames from the auto Depends. Set
# FFMPEG_PREFIX to that FFmpeg's install prefix (default /opt/ffmpeg, as the noble image sets it).
# See packaging/debian/README.md → "Ubuntu 24.04 LTS".

Description: Low-latency desktop/game streaming host (Moonlight + slipstream/1)
 slipstream is a Linux-first, low-latency desktop and game streaming host. It speaks
 the Moonlight/GameStream protocol (pair a stock Moonlight client) and its own native
 slipstream/1 protocol (GF(2^16) Leopard FEC + AES-GCM, mid-stream mode renegotiation,
 client microphone passthrough). Each session gets a virtual output at the client's
 exact resolution and refresh via a per-compositor backend (KWin, gamescope, Mutter,
 Sway/wlroots), captured zero-copy (dmabuf -> CUDA -> NVENC). Input (mouse, keyboard,
 gamepads) is injected back into the session.
 .
 NVENC + GPU EGL come from the NVIDIA driver (libnvidia-encode / libEGL_nvidia),
 installed out of band. After install: add yourself to the 'input' group for virtual
 gamepads, then enable the systemd user service slipstream-host.
