Description: Low-latency desktop/game streaming client (slipstream/1, GTK4)
 The native Linux client for slipstream, a Linux-first low-latency desktop and
 game streaming stack. Discovers hosts on the LAN (mDNS), trusts them via
 certificate pinning with a SPAKE2 PIN pairing ceremony, and streams HEVC video
 (GF(2^16) Leopard FEC + AES-GCM over UDP, QUIC control plane) with Opus audio,
 microphone passthrough, and full gamepad support including DualSense touchpad,
 motion, adaptive triggers and lightbar through SDL3.
 .
 The host creates a virtual output at exactly this client's resolution and
 refresh rate — no scaling. See the slipstream-host package for the host side.
