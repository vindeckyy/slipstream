"""Write a copy of a Cargo.lock with the microsoft/windows-rs git packages removed.

The slipstream workspace lockfile includes the windows-rs git dependencies — the whole
microsoft/windows-rs tree (windows-reactor + ~13 `windows-*` crates, all pinned to one git
rev) declared by `slipstream-client-windows` and `ss-client-core` (D3D11VA). The flatpak
builds ONLY the Linux binaries, which never compile them, but `flatpak-cargo-generator.py`
walks the whole lock and emits a `type: git` source for windows-rs; `flatpak-builder` then
FULL-clones that multi-GB repo at "Downloading sources" → "No space left on device",
failing the build. (The manifests that DECLARE the git dep are neutralized in the build
sandbox too — see prune-windows-toml.py — since `cargo --offline` needs every declared
dependency's source even for cfg(windows)-gated entries it never compiles.)

Stripping those packages from the lock the generator sees is safe: the committed Cargo.lock is
left untouched for the `--locked` build, and `cargo --offline` only needs vendored sources for
the crates it actually compiles (none of the windows-rs crates are in the Linux client's
dependency closure).

Dependency-free (no tomlkit) so it also runs on the Steam Deck's stock python. Matches on the
`source =` line specifically, so a crate that merely *lists* a windows-rs dependency is kept.

Usage: prune-windows-lock.py <in Cargo.lock> <out lock>
