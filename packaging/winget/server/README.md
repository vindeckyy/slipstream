# Slipstream winget REST source

A self-hosted [winget REST source](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli-restsource) serving the
Slipstream Windows host, so users can install and upgrade with `winget` instead of downloading a
`setup.exe` by hand.

```powershell
# one-time, from an ELEVATED prompt (winget requires admin to add a source)
winget source add -n slipstream https://winget.slipstream.unom.io -t Microsoft.Rest

winget install unom.SlipstreamHost                 # silent, wizard defaults
winget install unom.SlipstreamHost --interactive   # the full wizard
winget upgrade unom.SlipstreamHost
```

## Why self-hosted rather than the community repo

`microsoft/winget-pkgs` gates submissions on its `Binary-Validation-Error` /
`Validation-Defender-Error` checks, and the host installer is currently signed with a self-signed
cert (`CN=unom`). That is a pre-existing condition — winget does not sign anything, so SmartScreen
behaves identically whether the installer arrives by browser or by `winget` — but it does block that
route until a publicly trusted cert is in place. A self-hosted source has no such gate, can carry
`Agreements` (verified-developers-only upstream), and can serve channels the community repo would
never accept.

## What it implements

The winget client consumes exactly three endpoints. The reference implementation's other twenty
(`/packages/**`) are its **admin** API for mutating a CosmosDB; a catalogue generated at release
time has nothing to mutate, so they are not implemented.

| Endpoint | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| `GET /information` | Source identity, `ServerSupportedVersions`, declared capabilities. |
| `POST /manifestSearch` | `Query` / `Inclusions` (OR) / `Filters` (AND) / `FetchAllManifests`. **204** on no match — not an empty 200. |
| `GET /packageManifests/{id}` | Full manifest; honours `?Version=`. Identifier match is case-insensitive. |
| `GET /healthz` | Not part of the spec — liveness for compose. |

`NormalizedPackageNameAndPublisher` is deliberately declared **unsupported**. winget derives it
client-side from ARP entries with its own normalization (case folding plus stripping legal suffixes,
punctuation and version-like tails); claiming support would mean reimplementing that exactly, and a
near-miss silently mis-correlates an installed host. Correlation rides on `ProductCode` instead,
which Inno gives us exactly (`<AppId>_is1`).

## Layout

| File | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `handler.mjs` | The three endpoints. Pure `(Request, catalogue) -> Response`, no I/O, no deps. |
| `server.mjs` | node:http front. Loads the catalogue, reloads on mtime change. |
| `build-data.mjs` | Generates `data/data.json` from the published release manifests. Build-time only. |
| `test.mjs` | 28 checks driving `handler.mjs` directly. |
| `compose.production.yml` | The github-actions service. |

## How it runs

```
GitHub releases (manifest trio per stable tag)
        │  build-data.mjs   ← walks ALL releases, no local state   [CI, Linux job]
        ▼
   data/data.json (~8 KB)   ← rsynced to github-actions on each stable tag
        ▼
   bun + server.mjs on github-actions:3240  ←  edge Caddy TLS  ←  winget.slipstream.unom.io
```

Stock `oven/bun` image with the two `.mjs` files bind-mounted — the same shape as the flatpak server
(stock `caddy:2-alpine` + a bind-mounted Caddyfile). There is no image to build, publish or pull, so
a code change deploys by scp plus `docker compose up -d`.

The server has **zero dependencies**: it reads a generated JSON file. Parsing YAML and talking to
GitHub is `build-data.mjs`'s job, and that runs in CI. Only that build step needs `node_modules`.

**Content and config deploy separately**, matching the flatpak repo:

- `deploy-services.yml` (`winget` job) ships `compose.production.yml` + the two `.mjs` files.
- `windows-host.yml` (`winget-source` job) builds and ships `data/data.json` on each stable tag.

`server.mjs` reloads the catalogue when its mtime changes, so publishing a release needs no restart.
A half-written file mid-rsync keeps the previous catalogue rather than taking the source down.

### Why the catalogue is derived from releases

`build-data.mjs` walks the GitHub releases rather than reading local files. That is what makes
`winget install --version` and `winget upgrade` work: winget resolves both against the version
*list*, so a source that only knew the newest release could neither pin an older version nor show an
upgrade path from one.

It also means the source holds no state — re-running the build reproduces the same `data.json`, so a
lost deployment is one command away and nothing can drift.

## Local development

```bash
npm install
npm run build:local     # data/data.json from ../*.yaml (single version — fine for dev)
npm test                # 28 checks, no network, no server
npm start               # http://localhost:3240
```

`npm test` is the gate that matters. A malformed response does not fail loudly — winget reports "no
package found", so a shape regression looks like a missing package rather than a broken source. CI
runs it before anything reaches the box.

Note a real `winget source add` will not accept a local instance: it requires HTTPS with a publicly
trusted certificate, which is what the edge vhost provides in production.

## First-time setup

1. **DNS** — `winget.slipstream.unom.io` → the github-actions hcloud box, in the `unom.io` Cloudflare zone
   (DNS-only, same as `docs`). ✅ *done*
2. **Caddy vhost** on github-actions, next to the existing `docs.slipstream.unom.io` block:

   ```caddyfile
   winget.slipstream.unom.io {
       reverse_proxy 127.0.0.1:3240
   }
   ```

   Until this exists the hostname resolves but the TLS handshake fails — Caddy has no certificate
   for a name it does not serve. That is the expected state, not a broken deploy.
3. Run `deploy-services.yml` to place the compose file and start the container. It serves 503 until
   a catalogue exists — expected, and visible on `/healthz`.
4. Publish a stable tag, or build and ship the catalogue by hand:

```bash
cd packaging/winget/server && npm install && npm run build && npm test
scp data/data.json <deploy-user>@<github-actions>:~/unom-winget/data/data.json
```

Then verify from anywhere:

```bash
curl -s https://winget.slipstream.unom.io/information | jq .
curl -s -X POST https://winget.slipstream.unom.io/manifestSearch \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{"FetchAllManifests":true}' | jq '.Data[].PackageIdentifier'
```

> Releases published before winget support shipped have no manifests attached, so `npm run build`
> skips them. Until the first stable tag lands with them, build with `--local ..` to serve the
> checked-in manifests, or backfill the manifest trio onto an existing release.
