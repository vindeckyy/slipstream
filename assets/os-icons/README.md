# OS icon masters

The canonical OS/distro brand marks every client derives its host-card OS icon from
(web console inline SVGs, GTK symbolic icons, Apple template imagesets, Android
`ImageVector`s). One file per **icon token** of the host's OS-identity chain
(see `crates/slipstream-host/src/osinfo.rs` and `crates/ss-client-core/src/os.rs`):

| token | mark | source |
|---|---|---|
| `apple` | Apple (also `macos` via alias) | Font Awesome Free brands (CC BY 4.0) |
| `linux` | Tux | Font Awesome Free brands (CC BY 4.0) |
| `steam` | Steam (also `steamos` via alias) | Font Awesome Free brands (CC BY 4.0) |
| `ubuntu` | Ubuntu | Font Awesome Free brands (CC BY 4.0) |
| `fedora` | Fedora | Font Awesome Free brands (CC BY 4.0) |
| `opensuse` | SUSE | Font Awesome Free brands (CC BY 4.0) |
| `arch` | Arch Linux | Simple Icons (CC0 1.0) |
| `nixos` | NixOS | Simple Icons (CC0 1.0) |
| `debian` | Debian | Simple Icons (CC0 1.0) |
| `bazzite` | Bazzite | ublue-os/bazzite (Apache-2.0) |
| `cachyos` | CachyOS | Simple Icons (CC0 1.0) |
| `nobara` | Nobara | Simple Icons (CC0 1.0, slug `nobaralinux`) |

The last three are **distro leaves, not families**: a chain walks most-specific-first, so
`linux/fedora/bazzite` would otherwise draw the Fedora mark. They earn their own art because
"a Bazzite box" and "a Fedora box" are different machines to the person reading the card, and
they are what this project's hosts actually run. Every other distro with no file here (Pop!_OS,
Mint, …) still degrades to its family's mark and finally to Tux — that fallback is the design,
not a gap.

All files are monochrome (`fill="currentColor"`), original per-icon viewBoxes preserved. Because
those viewBoxes are not all square, a client must letterbox rather than stretch — see the aspect
note in `clients/android/.../components/OsIcons.kt`.

## Regenerating the per-client derivatives

`bash scripts/gen-os-icons.sh [token ...]` turns a master into the baked GTK symbolic SVG and
Apple template PDF forms, then prints the path data used by the web console, Decky plugin, and
Android client. Adding a **new** token also means adding it to each client's shipped-token list —
the script prints that checklist too.

## Licensing

Attribution notices live in `LICENSES/` and are folded into `THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.txt` by
`scripts/gen-third-party-notices.py`. The marks are trademarks of their respective owners; they
are used here nominatively — to *identify* the operating system a host runs, the standard
practice in this ecosystem — and imply no affiliation or endorsement.
